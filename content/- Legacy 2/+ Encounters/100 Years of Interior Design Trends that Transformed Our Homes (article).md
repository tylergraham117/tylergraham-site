# 100 Years of Interior Design Trends that Transformed Our Homes (article)
*Leanne Potts*


## 1920s

![[1920s.webp]]
### The Rise of the Art Deco Aesthetic
WWI and the 1918 flu pandemic were over. There was a sense of optimism and a burst of economic prosperity. This fueled a desire for glamour and luxury, leading to Art Deco. This featured bold silhouettes, rich colors, geometric patterns, luxurious fabrics, and mirrored/metallic finished.
After WWI, there was this general sense celebration and being done with war forever. It was an optimistic time and the future was bright. 
This meant buying new stuff, obviously. This is America. This new stuff took inspiration from the new technology of the era: cars, jazz, movies, radio. Industrial design heavily influenced furniture design. 
There's this streamlined aesthetic from cars and trains. 
Bold geometric patterns inspired by cubism (the first abstract style of modern art) appear in rugs and mosaic tile floors.
Starburst designs were also popular in upholstery, wallpaper, tiles, and light fixtures which is related to the idea of radio waves and crackling electricity.
The colors reflected the era's sense of optimism. Strong color contrasts appeared.
In 1922, King Tut's tomb was discovered. This led to lots of Egyptian motifs showing up. Things like lotus flowers, scarabs, and cats.
### Bauhaus Beginnings
At the same time, Bauhaus is born. This is the German school of industrial design. The defining principle is that form should follow function. It's the groundwork for minimalism. Designers stripped furniture down to its fundamentals, reducing everything down to simple geometric forms. 
They wanted to create objects that were beautiful, but could also be mass produced. This would allow the products to be available to anyone, not just the rich. They used steel, plywood, and plastic.

Ultimately, the 1920s was a reach for luxury.



## 1930s

![[1930s.webp]]

The stock market crashed in 1929, leading to the Great Depression. The banking system collapsed and the party of the 20s was over. 
Farms and homes were foreclosed. Wages plunged to a third of their 1929 peak. Austerity replaced glamour. People didn't have the money to spend on fancy home furnishings, so minimalism became a necessity, not an aesthetic choice.
Rooms were more open and spacious compared to the 20s because people has fewer belongings. There was a less cluttered look, and there was little to no art on the walls. 
To make up for the sparsely furnished rooms, people hung floral and striped wallpaper and laid down floral area rugs to visually fill the space. Colors became more subdued to soothe the somber mood of the era. This included soothing neutrals and cheerful pastels.
The 1930s were the golden age of radio, and living rooms were arranged around the family radio cabinet, which was treated like a piece of furniture, much like TVs in the latter part of the 20th century.
Art Deco influences lingered, mostly because people couldn't afford to replace their old stuff.
The style of the time was cleaner, lighter, and more streamlined than the more ornate Art Deco style. It was a celebration of mass-production and machine-made products. 
Things like [Jadeite](https://www.bhg.com/decorating/home-accessories/jadeite-history/), [Fiesta](https://fiestafactorydirect.com/pages/our-history) ware, and [McCoy pottery](https://mccoypotterycollectorssociety.org/mccoy-pottery/nelson-mccoy-pottery-history/) were popular due to being affordably prices and still stylish. 
High design still existed in this era, though. The late 30s marked the creation of Fallingwater, one of Frank Lloyd Wright's more celebrated creations. 
Also, as war started to brew in Europe due to the rise of the Nazis, many European designers fled to America, setting the stage for many shifts in the world of interior design. Some of these included [Walter Gropius](https://www.dezeen.com/2018/11/02/walter-gropius-bauhaus-100-founder-director-architecture-design/), founder of Bauhaus, and [Miles van der Rohe,](https://www.architecture.org/learn/resources/architecture-dictionary/entry/ludwig-mies-van-der-rohe/) who established design vocabulary that helped define Mid Century Modern architecture later on.



## 1940s

![[1940s.webp]]

The 1940s were defined by WWII. All of America's energy and resources went into the war. For the first half of the decade, basically nothing happens in the interior design world. Factories stopped making furniture and consumer goods, and started making tanks and bullets and fighter planes instead. Even Fiesta dishware stopped production to make china for armed forces.

But the war ended in 1945, and a new era began. Soldiers returned home. They wanted to buy houses and start families. Residential real estate exploded, and factories went back to making consumer goods instead of war supplies. But readjusting took a bit, which meant there was a bit of a material shortage right after the war. This led to houses being built small and at low cost. Most homes from the late 1940s were just under 1000 sqft. 

Demand. for houses far exceeded supply, so builders looked for shortcuts. They settled on finishing only one level of the house, leaving the attic or basement to the homeowner. 

Since metals were in short supply, wood was the material of choice. Often, it was cheap, knotty pine panelling. 

Dark wood furniture was popular, partly because that's what was left from the pre-WWII era and partly because people wanted to give their homes a cozy feel after the atrocities of the war.

Kitchens had easy to clean linoleum floors, built in cabinets, long stretches of countertop, and electrical appliances. Appliances were mostly white because of the retooling in factories post war, so they had no capacity for other colors. As Americans worried about polio, white appliances felt sanitary and safe, so it was a welcome limitation.

Ultimately, the 1940s were a transitional period.




## 1950s

![[1950s.webp]]

WWII was over. The United States was an economic powerhouse. Wages soared. Unemployment fell. The Great Depression was a distant memory for most, and there was money to spend again. People wanted houses and cars and furniture. And kids. Lots of kids. The baby boom led to nearly 37 million children being born in the 1950s. 

The development of suburbs continued and accelerated as they were connected by new highway systems.

Bright, happy colors were in every room of the house. Popular hues included turquoise, coral, pale yellow, mint green, and light blue. Pink was also peak 1950s. First Lady Mamie Eisenhower loved pink and America loved Mamie.

### Modernism (now known as Mid-Century Modern) Makes It Mainstream
The chairs created by Bauhaus designers in pre-WWII Europe made their way into the homes of middle America.

Eames chairs of all types, from steel to plastic to wood, made their way into homes.

Scandinavian furniture began to replace heavy, ornate seating of the past with light wood and organic, minimalist lines. This was due both to modernism's forward-looking aesthetic as well as the optimism of the era. Additionally, minimalist modern furniture could be mass-produced to meet the well-funded middle-class desire to shop.

Terrazzo floors went mainstream because they were easy to clean and take care of and went with anything. 

### Open Floor Plans and Outdoor Entertaining
Open floor plans surged in popularity, and huge windows brought the outdoors inside.

Houses got larger, too, as the baby boom continued to explode. By the end of the decade, the [average house size was 1,200 square](https://compasscaliforniablog.com/have-american-homes-changed-much-over-the-years-take-a-look/) feet, 35% bigger than ten years earlier.

Ranch style houses were popular because they could connect all the living areas within the need for stairs.

The newly prosperous American middle class had leisure time and increasingly spent it on their home patio. The labor movement regulated office hours, so Americans had free time on weekends and evenings. [Plastic dishware like melamine](https://www.bhg.com/decorating/home-accessories/melamine-dishware-history/) allowed for casual outdoor entertaining with the neighbors.

In 1955, the [USSR announced it was going to launch the first artificial satellite](https://www.rmg.co.uk/stories/topics/space-race-timeline), and the Space Race began. It defined the era. Atomic Age motifs ­like starbursts and boomerangs ­appeared on everything, including barware, clocks, lamps, and upholstery. Much like the 1920s, transportation and new technologies drove design. Only instead of cars and trains, it was rockets.



## 1960s

![[1960.webp]]

In the 1960s, counterculture blossomed. Now teens, the kids born after World War II rebelled against tradition, and America was changing thanks to the women's movement, the civil rights movement, a sexual revolution, and the Beatles. Everything from fashion to home decor became more dynamic, graphic, and colorful.

There's a playful aspect to the 60s. There's a rise in individualism after time had passed post war. This manifests in self expressive decor. 

Families sought still larger homes to accommodate the baby boom. Split level houses allowed more living space in a tighter footprint. 

Homes felt more airy, with open shelves and floating staircases instead of solid walls.

America's continuing economic prosperity drove tastes. Matching furniture was big because it was a symbol of status. It showed you could afford to buy an entire roomful of furniture all at once. 

Hippies and counterculture rose in opposition to the Vietnam War, influencing interior design. Graphic floral patterns inspired by the peace movement's flower power theme appeared on wallpaper, upholstery, rugs, and curtains. Vibrant colors and patterns influenced by Morocco and India showed up on accessories. However, all that groovy peace and love stemmed from something less than sunny. Anxiety about the Cold War and the Vietnam War inspires a longing for nature and the outdoors.

By the end of the decade, we put a man on the moon, but America's love of all things futuristic and machine-made begins to waver, setting the stage for a new era.


## 1970s

![[1970s.webp]]


Self-expression was the driving ethos of the 1970s. Called the "Me Decade" by novelist Tom Wolfe, it was a time of shag carpet, houseplants, wicker furniture, and avocado-green appliances.

This inward turn was in part a reaction to bad news. An energy crisis had Americans waiting in line for gasoline, inflation soared, we lost the Vietnam War, and Ohio's Cuyahoga River was so polluted it caught fire in 1969. The environmentalism movement was born with the first Earth Day in 1970.

People start bringing plants indoors and going for earth tones to feel one with nature. Americans started to fall out of love with machines and the future, and began embracing nature and romanticizing the past.

Maximalism replaced the clean lines of modernist furniture and finishes that had reigned for generations. Houseplants, woven textiles, and [macramé owls](https://www.bhg.com/decorating/home-accessories/owl-decorating-history/)—many handmade—filled homes.

People wanted to express themselves creatively, so they made simple objects for fun. There was a nostalgia for the days when people made stuff rather than buying everything off an assembly line.

Nature-inspired finishes like stone, granite, and wicker were also popular. Many houses built in the 1970s had massive, rough-hewn stone fireplaces or stone exterior siding. Wood paneling hit peak popularity.

With a nod to the outdoors, kitchens featured wood cabinets, butcher-block countertops, and appliances in [harvest gold, avocado green, and brown](https://www.bhg.com/70s-paint-color-trends-7970754). Terra-cotta tile floors were also popular, and sunken living rooms replaced patios as the place to socialize.

Despite all the earthy colors and boho accents, the '70s also had some shine, thanks to the influence of disco. Studio 54 was born in this era, after all. Chrome accents appeared on lamps and coffee tables, and foil wallpaper decorated bedrooms, bathrooms, and living spaces. Yes, the design dissonance was as powerful as the cultural dissonance.


## 1980s

![[1980s.webp]]

The 1980s were a time of excess. America saw the rise of Reaganomics, MTV, the personal computer, yuppies, and an eclectic collection of interior design trends.

There were lots of things going on at once. It seems like this is where "American Culture" really starts to fragment.

Women were solidly back in the workforce, so you've got a lot of two-income homes with money to spend on home furnishings. Until the stock market crash at the end of the decade, there's money for seemingly frivolous things.

Maximalism was in; minimalism was out. Decorating styles were diverse, but excess was the underlying theme. Earth tones and the longing for nature ended. Instead, we embraced bright colors, including soft pastels inspired by _Miami Vice_ and the primary colors of Memphis design. Houseplants were replaced with silk floral arrangements and overstuffed sofas covered in floral chintz, an effect of the English cottage style [made popular by Laura Ashley](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/21/t-magazine/laura-ashley-batsheva.html).

A surge of luxe colors reflected the affluence and optimism of the time. Rich color palettes included turquoise and peach, as well as shades like hunter green and burgundy associated with southwestern design.

[Memphis design](https://www.bhg.com/decorating/decorating-style/memphis-design/), a postmodern design movement from Italy, was over-the-top whimsy, embracing bright colors and bold geometric patterns. It rejected the stripped-down look of modernism and overstated the ornamentation. The original MTV logo is perhaps the most well-known example of Memphis design, in addition to the sets on _Saved By The Bell_. This edgy style showed up in homes in the form of playful objects that favored form over function. Squiggle-print upholstery, zig-zag throw pillows, pops of neon color, terrazzo tabletops, and coffee tables with round legs all exhibited the look.

Houses got larger, with the average reaching 2,000 square feet by the end of the decade. Floor plans included the first open kitchens designed for family living, merging dining and family rooms with the cooking area. 


## 1990s

![[1990s.webp]]

Americans entered the '90s with cautious optimism. The Berlin Wall fell in '89, ending the Cold War and a sense of unease. For the first time in generations, Americans craved minimalism, rebelling against the neon colors, big hair, and floral chintz excess of the previous decade.

The World Wide Web entered the mainstream, and [techno and grunge](https://www.bhg.com/grungecore-7972177) music rose to prominence. Since much of pop culture came from the Pacific Northwest, color palettes became more muted. Sage, greige, dark green, rustic golds, terra-cotta, earthy reds, and beige filled homes across the nation.

Loft apartments with exposed brick and metal took off. Its a more raw approach to interiors.

Another outcome of repurposing items, the [shabby-chic aesthetic](https://www.bhg.com/decorating/decorating-style/cottage/shabby-chic-style-history/) combined flea market finds into a thoroughly eclectic style.

Chunky wood tables flaunted Provençal tablecloths in French blue and gold, and oversized wood cabinets featured ornate molding. Granite countertops became a must-have, appliances were black, and kitchens were generally dark due to color and finish choices.

When it came to walls, texture was tops. Stencils, sponge-painting, and faux finishes made interior walls look like leather, stucco, marble, ancient frescoes—anything but drywall. Vases with silk, plastic, or dried plants replaced houseplants, still considered a dated relic of the Carter era.



## 2000s

![[2000s.webp]]

The internet is part of daily life. iPhones are invented. Amazon creates Prime. 

McMansions filled the suburbs, with the average house measuring 2,300 square feet—double that of just two generations earlier. Houses were built with open floor plans, high ceilings, bonus rooms, and even home theaters.

As kitchens got bigger, islands became a staple, allowing for a more open layout and additional workspace. Stainless steel became the must-have appliance material, appearing on everything from ovens to refrigerators to toasters to microwaves. Shiny steel was appealingly futuristic.

Another reason for the stainless-steel surge: More men were cooking. Women had been in the workforce for a while so there was a shift in roles at home and the kitchen is no longer a gendered space. Unlike the pink kitchens of the 1950s, stainless steel was gender-neutral.

[Granite was the finish of choice for countertops](https://www.bhg.com/kitchen/countertop/granite/) and backsplashes in both the kitchen and bathrooms. Other natural materials, including marble, soapstone, quartzite, and concrete, ticked up in popularity, too.

Trendy colors of the era included sandy beiges, blue-greens, soft golds, chocolate browns, and deep reds. After watershed moments like Y2K and 9/11, Americans looked for warmth and calm at home. Our desire for comfort got even more urgent when the Great Recession struck in 2007, sending many of the aforementioned McMansions into foreclosure.

Seeking respite amid uncertain times, some homeowners found comfort in spa bathrooms with deep garden tubs and steam showers. To fill vast rooms in huge houses, furniture got the super-size treatment. Living rooms were furnished with oversized leather sofas and armchairs called chair-and-a-halfs that were big enough to accommodate two kids and the golden retriever. King-size sleigh beds made of dark wood or covered in leather were also popular, as were enormous entertainment centers that could accommodate your 48-inch TV, DVD player, and cable box.

However, not everything was larger than life. Tailored, tight-back sofas made a comeback, replacing the slouchy, pillow-backed sofas of the previous era.

Interest in midcentury style comes back a bit, and excess begins to give way to another round of minimalism.


## 2010s

![[2010s.webp]]

**By the 2010s, America had climbed out of the Great Recession and into a new decade.** Technology had so thoroughly pervaded our lives that you could get furniture equipped with USB ports. Smart tech began to automate homes, making it possible to turn on lights, adjust the thermostat, and open the blinds through an app. Flat-screen TVs hung over the fireplace where art used to be.

Social media sensation Instagram launched at the dawn of the decade and quickly became a source of inspiration, aspiration, and FOMO (fear of missing out, that is). The platform provided a wealth of home ideas and offered a place to post photos of personal design accomplishments.

### The Gaines Effect
One of the era's most notable interior touchstones, [_Fixer Upper_](https://www.bhg.com/new-magnolia-shows-7969149) premiered in 2014. The HGTV series featured Chip and Joanna Gaines transforming Texas tract houses into modern farmhouses with shiplap walls and various [shades of white](https://www.bhg.com/decorating/color/paint/best-white-paint-colors/). The show's success ushered in the ubiquitous farmhouse-style kitchen, which featured open shelves, reproduction Jadeite dishes, apron-front sinks, white subway tile backsplashes, and marble or engineered quartz countertops. Stainless-steel appliances continued their reign and hardwood was the flooring of choice.

What was so appealing about living in a farmhouse when we could simply say "Siri, order a pizza" and have a medium Hawaiian show up 30 minutes later? In short, tech was getting tiring. "We were romanticizing what the simple life was before the internet, before traffic, before we had to get three kids to nine different activities in two days," Gatlin says. "We were imagining a life where you just worked on your farm and then knit in the evening, forgetting, of course, all the hardships that came with farm life."

With [modern farmhouse style](https://www.bhg.com/decorating/decorating-style/modern-farmhouse-decor/) came barn doors installed on closets, pantries, bathrooms, and more. More than a rustic statement feature, these sliding doors needed less clearance space than a swinging door and doubled as room dividers, making them a good solution for tight spaces.

### What's Old Is New Again
On the opposite end of the style spectrum, midcentury modern—first popularized in the 1950s—came roaring back into homes across America in the form of Nakashima knockoffs, [Knoll office chairs](https://www.knoll.com/shop/work-from-home/work-chairs), and atomic clocks. Herman Miller started making a new line of classic modern furniture that included iconic designs such as [Eames chairs](https://www.hermanmiller.com/products/seating/lounge-seating/eames-lounge-chair-and-ottoman/) and [Nelson Marshmallow sofas](https://www.hermanmiller.com/products/seating/lounge-seating/nelson-marshmallow-sofa/)
The 2010s also saw the return of houseplants, which had fallen by the wayside after the 1970s. This live-plant revival was attributed to millennials, many of whom had put off having children due to student loan debt and found that succulents and fiddle leaf figs filled their need to nurture. This young, eco-conscious generation brought nature indoors through plants to create their own urban jungles.

By 2015, [houses averaged nearly 2,700 square feet](https://www.rocketmortgage.com/learn/average-square-footage-of-a-house), three times the size in 1950. This was due to historically low interest rates that made it cheaper to build, as well as a rise in multigenerational living.

Apart from all-white everything, color trends of the 2010s included gray and millennial pink, a soft rosy hue that harkened back to the 1950s. Millennials are nostalgic for an era they never experienced, an era of exuberance and optimism, a time when the government really looked after people.


## 2020s

![[2020s.webp]]

Maximalism is definitely a thing again.

Over-the-top interiors have replaced farmhouse minimalism, and popular colors include rich blues, deep greens, and warm pastels. [Pantone's 2022 color of the year](https://www.bhg.com/decorating/color/colors/how-to-decorate-with-pantone-color-of-the-year/) was a rich shade of purple, demonstrating just how far we've come from the years of all white. Even kitchen cabinets are getting a color treatment.

Meanwhile, [grandmillennial style](https://www.bhg.com/decorating/lessons/expert-advice/grandmillennial-style/)—a twist on traditional—resurrected mauve, florals, patterned wallpaper, and rich colors. We've gone from the restrained styling of open shelves to houseplant-packed urban jungles courtesy of [Hilton Carter](https://www.bhg.com/gardening/houseplants/wild-for-houseplants/).

An ongoing global pandemic, rising inflation, and a war in Europe have created a desire for comfort, color, and the soothing qualities of nature. Natural elements like stone finishes and organic shapes and materials are especially in demand, and we've doubled down on spa bathrooms, installing rainfall shower heads and jet spray systems.

With a rise in remote work, designated home offices have become a necessity. Zoom rooms (or corners) provide a place for conference calls with a pretty background that's free of distractions.

As eco-minded millennials and Gen Z look to the future, a mix-and-match aesthetic has firm footing. Weary of disposable furniture, the next generations fill their homes with thrift store finds and upcycled antiques. There's a concern that buying new everything is no longer sustainable. We're looking for ways to lighten our carbon footprint by reusing and recycling, and that's showing up in the design choices we make.
