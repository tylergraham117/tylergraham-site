# Kliebler's Law

[[Where Good Ideas Come From (book)]] pg8

A phenomenon discovered by Max Kliebler.

> "Scientists have long observed that as life gets bigger, it slows down. Flies live for hours or days; elephants life for half-centuries. The hearts of birds and small mammals pump blood much faster than those of giraffes and blue whales. But the relationship between size and speed didn't seem to be a linear one. A horse might be five hundred times heavier than a rabbit, yet its pulse certainly wasn't five hundred times slower than the rabbit's."

> "If you plotted mass versus metabolism on a logarithmic grid, the result was a perfectly straight line that led from rats and pigeons all the way up to bulls and hippopotami. "

> "Metabolism scales to mass to the negative quarter power."


Basically, you find out how much heavier something is than something else in the form of a multiple. Then you take the square root twice. That's how much longer it will probably live. 

More interestingly, the number of heartbeats per lifetime tends to be stable from species to species. Bigger animals just take longer to use up their quota.

#note/question‚ùì Does this mean a slower heart beat leads to a longer life?

Kliebler's law has been found to extend down to bacteria and cell metabolism. Even plants obey negative quarter-power scaling. 



Years later, theoretical physicist Geoffrey West wanted to investigate if this applied to human built cities, which are a sort of organism in their own right.
It turned out that when it came to creative relative datapoints, [[cities follow a positive quarter-power law]].
