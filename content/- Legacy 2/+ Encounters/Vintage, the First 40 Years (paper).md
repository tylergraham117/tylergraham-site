# Vintage, the First 40 Years (paper)
*Nancy L. Fischer*


## Introduction 
- Fashion usually connotes fast change and up to the minute trendiness, yet 'retro' styles, which is just wearing decades old stuff, is 'in'.
- Vintage dressing has been fashionable for over 40 years.
- The US has massively influenced the worlds vintage style due to its volume of media exports.
- 'Vintage' is wrapped up in cultural constructions of authenticity and is symbolically opposed to mass production and standardized shopping experiences.
- Vintage emerged as an alternative form of consumption while the garment industry became more industrial.

## Anachronistic Dressing, Retro and Vintage
- Wearing decades-old, period specific, recognizable looks can be called "anachronistic dressing." (Angela McRobbie, 1988)
- "Retro usually refers to new reproductions of old looks."
- Since retro can encompass both old and new, some characterize 'retrochic' as inauthentic and mess, blurring the line between past and present. (Samuel 1994, 'Theatres of Memory', Verso Press)
- In a sense, the term "vintage" represents a semantic attempt to reclaim authenticity for genuinely old clothing and objects, distinguishing them from retro reproduction, as well as serving as a marker of distinction from contemporary secondhand clothes.
- [[origin of vintage]]
- The American press, in certain instances, use a more simple definition of vintage: "*clothing that is 20 years old or more, with a recognizable decades-old look.*"



## Researching Vintage and Retro Style
- Vintage fashion emerges first in Britain, soon after they undergo a retrospective taste shift for homes.
	- Architectural historic preservation and appreciation of period style arose in contrast to the clean lines and modernization of the 1950s-1960s.
- Vintage clothing and retro aesthetics emerge with the development of alternative consumerism, which emphasizes natural products such as organic food and green consumer goods. This alternative consumerism emerged in the 60s, but got more popular in the following couple decades.  **What is happening in the US during this time?**
- Alternative consumerism is part of a counter culture and includes "outlaw fashions" such as punk. It's a symbol of rebellion and signal of belonging to the community of the "anti-culture" in a post war, assumably more nationalistic than usual society in Britain.
- Part of the allure of dressing vintage is alternate consumption, but wearing vintage has lost its explicit anti fashion meaning. Instead, it's actually become a key marker of fashionability, with an emphasis on how the items are sources rather than just the look itself. (Sophie Woodward, 2009)
- In the 70s and 80s, young people adopted vintage out of economic necessity both on the side of consumers and businesses. There were "rag markets" in London where used clothing stalls popped up, providing income to people selling and affordable clothes to people buying.
	- These rag markets blurred the line between high fashion and street style.
- Vintage dressing likely became accepted in street style because popular culture consisted of lots of retro-themed films, television, and books. Including:
	- American Graffiti
	- The Great Gatsby
	- Annie Hall
	- The China Syndrome
	- Lacombe Lucien (Louis Malle, France)
- Past imagery becomes more available than ever in human history.
	- In the 1970s, old TV shows return as reruns. 
	- The distribution of old stuff is a new thing. This brings old pop culture to the forefront again. This is something the internet and streaming makes possible even more  consistently, creating the ability for something to be consumed long after its created. We forget this used to not be a thing.
	- The same is true of music and album covers. Musicians often drive fashion trends quite a bit.
- Another explanation for the rise of vintage is the experience. There's a sense of spontaneity and discovery. There are also bragging rights associated with finding a diamond in the rough.
- Wearing vintage requires searching for items. This usually means nobody else will have the same garment. There's a status game going on here. Higher status comes from knowledge and effort. 
- Thompson's Rubbish Theory


## The Emergence of Vintage
### 1950s: Secondhand as Charity
- Factory made clothing becomes widely available, which means wearing used clothing becomes associated with poverty.
	- So nobody wants to, because being poor is not a good look. It's not cool
- This is the period where wearing things that look dated becomes a marker of low social status.
- This association between used clothes and poverty pretty much exists from the 1890s-1950s.
- Post WW2, the US has a flourishing economy. This means everyone wants new stuff. There's a big shift in design here as well.
- The retooling of factories as well as a prosperous economy and growing middle class means that second hand stuff is not the vibe, basically.
- "Vintage" still means a specific year, not just old.

### 1960s: From Resale Shops to New Youth Style
- Resale shops start to be an acceptable place to purchase secondhand clothing. But not regular clothing. It's designer level stuff, and only really up to 2 years old. Stores often refused anything older than that.
- In 1966, an article portrays thrift stores as a place to find designer clothing. They even mention a store where Barbra Streisand shops. This is a huge contrast from before.
	- This is the first notable piece of media where thrift stores and secondhand are associated with celebrity.
	- "Thrift Shops: a Small Boom in Big Bargains." The Times. 1966
- In 1967, the meaning of vintage finally shifts to mean decades old clothing.
	- "Searching for the Ragman's Pack and Finding Fashion"
	- The article is mocking the youths. There's a sense of amusement. But those kids eventually grow up.

### 1970s: The Mainstreaming of Vintage Dressing
#### Early 1970s - Rising Popularity
- By this time, vintage is pretty 'cool,' so not only are old things being purchased, but companies are recycling old styles as retro but new items.
- Capitalism and consumerism have gotten ahold of this idea of vintage, which was original a counter-culture to consumerism.
	- What started as inherently anti establishment became a popular pass time for the middle class as well as a popular style in higher fashion.
	- This all leads to higher prices of vintage items.
- In a 1973 article by Barbara Delatiner, the owner of a vintage shop in East Hampton called 'Rag Garden' (Mrs. Frank) describes why vintage is becoming popular:
	- "The fabrics are soft and flowing. Sensuous and marvelous to feel... So many of the things, too, are handmade as opposed to the machine-made mass-produced clothes today. And the colors are so vibrant, so alive." 
	- "It's not nostalgia. They haven't spend their youth in the thirties and forties and I don't have many fifties pieces in here." (most of her customers were in their 20s-30s)
	- This means that people were shopping here for the inherent quality of the older garments.
#### 1970s: Peak Vintage?
- In 1975, Caterine Milinaire and Carol Troy publish 'Cheap Chic,' which is the first consumer guidebook to thrift store shopping and vintage style. 
	- In it, "Old clothes give you a sense of continuity with the past - an elegant way of life lived in luxurious fabrics of strict tailoring, a life of fluttering afternoon rituals and evening formalities. Solid old clothes give you a feeling that in this throwaway world there are still some things around that can last ten, twenty, thirty, forty years, or more, and remain beautiful."
		- This is clearly about the quality of the product.
- In the 70s, demand starts to outpace supply. Or at least some people worry about this happening.

#### Late 1970s: The Vintage Trend Reaches the Fashion Press
- Magazines introduce vintage to their mainstream audiences.
- In the late 70s, you're only going to find high quality fabrics and intricate details in high levels of fashion, which are prohibitively expensive by this point.
- The elites of the fashion world were never really bought into the vintage thing. They sort of looked down on it.

### 1980s: The Establishment and Diffusion of Vintage Style
- By then, vintage is pretty well known in fashion circles.
- In 1983, 'Harriet Love's Guide to Vintage Chic' comes out. So does Trina Irick-Nauer's 'First Price Guide to Vintage and Antique Clothes.'
	- Guidebooks are a key way that old styles are newly marketed as collectable and are no longer trash.
	- They basically popularize specific old styles and decide what is cool again.
- In "Clothes that Get Better with Age" (Julie Hatfield, 1985, Boston Globe), "Customers like these are obviously not looking for the savings they make by shopping for used clothes. They want what, in many cases, mass production has denied them at any price: fabrics and workmanship that are the best, and the certainty that you will not meet the very same outfit on scores of other people."
- "The belief that clothing should reflect one's individuality rather than a style trend is part of a larger cultural discourse of expressing one's authentic self through consumption" (Gilmore and Pine 2007. "Authenticity: What Consumers Really Want")
	- There's a self expression through consumption 
- Ecological impacts are something to note, but they're mostly an afterthought to most. (Betty Taylor 1980, Christian Science Monitor, 'Vintage Clothing Makes a Comeback') 
- There is a nostalgic part of this. 
	- "Scholars have characterized nostalgia as a key factor driving vintage purchases, that vintage consumers look fondly on the past."
	- Old clothes provide a "sense of continuity with the past." (Milinaire and Troy, 1975, 'Cheap Chic')

### Summary
Vintage clothing as a trend emerged in London in the 1960s. It migrated to NYC, where it spent the next few decades spreading across the US. Vintage boutiques opened in many cities, and anachronistic dressing became an acceptable street style.
Vintage style remained popular as a form of alternative consumption. Consumers appreciated its economic value, quality, originality, lack of ecological impact, and history.
Not has much changes regarding vintage clothing since the 1980s. 
Customers still appreciate the same features (high quality for low prices, originality, eco consciousness, nostalgia).

## Vintage as Authentic Alternative Market to Mass-Produced First-Cycle Market
- New and secondhand items don't exist exclusively as separate markets. It's better to think of them relationally. People combine the two to create a unique style that you can't get with just one or the other.
- "Current fashionable silhouettes that are "in" influence which decades are also popular in vintage boutiques. The consumer landscape of vintage thus depends on what is occurring in the first-cycle clothing market."
	- Whichever styles are popular in the mainstream market influence which decades of vintage are popular.
- "The relational dynamic between first-cycle and secondhand market provides a more plausible explanation for the persistence of vintage style than economic changes during the same period."
- While economic recession may be a catalyst for vintage shopping, its not the only explanation. 
	- The 1970s witnessed a boom in vintage during the economic recession, but vintage style also continued to remain trendy during the economic prosperity of the 80s and 90s and onward.

## Garment Industry Changes (1960s-1990s)
- Over the course of this period, we see the garment industry (and many industries, really) become increasingly corporatized. Rather than tons of designers selling their clothes, it becomes a few big corporations.
	- These companies all took their stock public, meaning they have an obligation to share holders to prioritize profits over basically everything.
	- In doing so, they also started licensing their brand name out to products that were produced not in-house.
		- This means quality control becomes an issue, diminishing consumer confidence about the worth of designer label clothing.
- In the 1980s, companies develop 'lifestyle marketing' where brands emphasize their messaging and image over the product's intrinsic qualities. (Naomi Klein, 'No Logo: Taking Aim at the Brand Bullies', 2000)
- Standardization and dull shopping experiences became the norm. Basically, department store floors become homogenized. Instead of being able to comparison shop in departments like coats, dresses, formal-ware, etc., they start to become sorted by brand. This drains the sense of spontaneity and discovery out of the department store shopping experience. ('Point of Purchase', Sharon Zukin, 2004)
	- Something which secondhand shopping solves for.
- Fast fashion merely accelerated the tendencies of vintage shopping, but the trend was present before fast fashion was really a thing. (I thought it was a bigger driver tbh)
	- It does, however, give little reason to buy new stuff for the type of person that enjoys vintage. The quality and originality are just stripped away entirely.

## Vintage Clothing's Authenticity versus Mass Production
- "Objects and experiences deemed authentic are often associated with nature, tradition, heritage, the pat, craft, originality, and reflecting one's core identity." 
- Customers eventually become dissatisfied with goods and services in and of themselves. Instead, they expect companies to cultivate compelling experiences. This is described as the 'experience economy'. (Gilmore and Pine, 2007)
- Because of the desire for authentic, experience focused brands, companies start to put a marketing focus on 'authenticity claims' that attempt to obscure the industrial processes involved in manufacturing things. 
	- This is like when corporations use small family owned imagery.
		- Think Trader Joe's or like a wine company emphasizing 'family tradition.'
- In clothing and likely other industries, the distinctions consumers make about what is 'authentic' and what is not is often based in falsehood. It serves to make us feel better and give us a sense of moral superiority about purchasing less industrialized products when we buy vintage, but it was probably almost just as industrialized. 
	- For example, even today, most clothing is technically made by a person at a sewing machine. There's just a much smaller focus on quality and a higher focus on low cost and quantity than there was before.
- In post-war society, attention to design became paramount. There was a sort of aestheticization of everyday life.
- The authenticity of vintage clothing is socially constructed by the people that wear it. They decide which styles of the past constitute a 'genuine' signification of a particular decade.
- Vintage appears to be craft because of the way it's displayed in todays boutiques in small quantities, implying a limited supply and production. In reality, they were probably quite standardized when they were made, but the copies that once hung next to it on the store rack are long gone now.
	- Perceived scarcity.
- Nostalgia, in the context of vintage, takes on multiple meanings.
	- Idealization of the past
	- Justifiable appreciation of the quality of past production methods.
- The experience of shopping vintage is much more engaging than department stores, and way more engaging than the online shopping of today. Less convenient for sure, but it's not always about convenience. It's not like we're going to the thrift store for toothpaste.
