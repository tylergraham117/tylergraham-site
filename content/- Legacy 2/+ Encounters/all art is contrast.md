# all art is contrast



In the filmmaking community, I hear the word "cinematic" a lot. This word is fine, and we all sort of get what it means, but how do we define "cinematic"? Is it moody lighting? Is it depth of field? No. Obviously not, because we can find beautiful cinematic shot from film that aren't either of those. So what do people mean by cinematic?

I think they mean the shot contains well balanced contrast.

Contrast is essential to good art. And when I say contrast, I don't mean in the little slider in Lightroom. 

There are lots of different types of contrast in lots of different mediums, and any of them can lend to the contrast that makes art worthwhile.

In film, there is contrast of light, color, texture, composition, size, and the list goes on.

In clothing, texture, size, color, fabric, etc.

In music, volume, tempo, instrument, pitch, etc.

Every form of art has a multitude of variables, and all of them can be adjusted to create contrast. 

There's story contrast, will characters and personalities and themes and prose and sentence structure.

Balancing the contrasting elements of your medium is the sole role of the artist. The better an artist is at this, the further they can push their craft. This is why [[less is only more when you know what more is]]. 

We have to push our craft to the point of not being good anymore, and then it back in. This is how we find our true boundaries, not ones we set internally and arbitrarily.

All good art has a foundation of contrast.

We only understand and perceive things in relation to other things, so contrast give us a way to view things more clearly. 

As people. [[we don't notice our objective status]]. Only in contrast can we see and understand.

All [[art is about noticing]] what most people don't. Illuminating the contrast that exists is how we show other people what we've noticed. Contrast and [[change makes us pay attention]]. But to find art, we have to [[pay attention to the world]].
