# art only matters with context

Art is only important when we have context.

Growing up, I would look at art and think "I could do that. What's the big deal?" This is especially prevalent in modern art. Now, I know that the obvious response to that statement is, "Well, maybe. But you didn't."

People derive meaning from the art. Sure. 
But I think people derive more meaning from the artist. 

From the backstory of the human being that made that piece. From the circumstances and challenges. A [[story must have conflict]].

Because [[humans are natural storytellers]], we are all drawn to those backstories. That [[story is what makes empathy possible]]. 


The whole idea around art's importance is what the art is tied to. Contextual factoids make the art important. These can include the process of creating the art, (ex: how long it took the artist, where the materials were from, etc.) what the intended message was, when the piece was created, what was happening in the world around them, etc.



I never understood why people cared about art. I thought it was dumb. Then I started to learn about the context surrounding art and the meaning started to change. I started to actually care. 

Maybe if more people were taught the interesting things surrounding art - the context - they would be more inclined to appreciate it. This is the goal of any art appreciation class, but I think the presentation is lacking in excitement. 




Contextualize books by reading their original copyright date. This helps to understand where the writer was in time.

I recently read Encyclopedia of an Ordinary Life by AKR. In it, before getting into the actual substance of the book, the author provided some unique markers of the time period. This contextualized the work.
Similarly, if the author says something that's probably not great (like if they're racist or sexist, for example), we can look back at the date. If it's recent, they're an on purpose asshole. If it's super old, they're just a sheep asshole, following along with crowd and not really thinking for themselves.



Videos of people creating art and then showing the end result are fascinating because we get to see the context under which the art is created. 

One time I was filming a video for a friend at a barber shop. At some point, this guy came out with a bottle full of salt. He proceeded to make a portrait with the salt. I've seen a lot of portraits, but something about this one was interesting. The fact that it was made of salt was cool, but the process of watching it be made was the important distinction.
