# athletes use mantras

Athletes often use [[mantras]] to help realign them when things get hard.

Mostly, it's just to take their mind off of a churning stomach, sore legs, nervousness, or whatever challenge lies ahead.

Mantras are really powerful tools for this because they're simple summaries of your beliefs that can encourage and excite you. 

This is helpful, especially when things are as hard as in something like an ultramarathon, because [[excitement is a better motivator than discipline]].
