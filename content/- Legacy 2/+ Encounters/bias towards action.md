# bias towards action


When you have an idea, there are three real options. 
1. Forget about it. Bad idea, no big deal.
2. Think about it. The idea needs work. 
3. Act on it. Put it out into the world.

Option 3 is the only way to really vet your idea. If it never gets out of your head, it's not a real thing. It just stays an idea.

Developing a bias towards action seems to be the best way to bring more positivity into the world and actually see your ideas through til success.

There's a secret fourth option. And that is to do nothing. Unfortunately, that's the graveyard that most ideas end up.

How do we develop a bias towards action? It seems like the only real way is to force ourself into [[manufactured discomfort]].
