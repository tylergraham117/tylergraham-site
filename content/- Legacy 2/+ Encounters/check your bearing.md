# check your bearing


A video about compasses, realigning with your values, and visual reminders of what you believe in.



If you're a degree off, after x many miles, you're way off track. (find the stats) If you don't check your heading, you'll end up somewhere wildly different than where you set out. 
This isn't to say we know exactly where we're going. Most successes and the best adventures come when we're figuring it out along the way. But we know the direction. If we allow ourselves to go with the flow too much, we'll end up taking the path of least resistance, doing things that don't align with our beliefs/values, and regretting it.
