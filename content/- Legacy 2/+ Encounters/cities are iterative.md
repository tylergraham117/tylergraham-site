# cities are iterative
[[urban planning]]

You can't fully plan a city from the ground up at the beginning. This is because no city planner can assume and accommodate every citizen's needs. They also can't predict the future. Cities are build for people, not the other way around. We have to be open to changing things and understanding that sometimes [[we have to lose what exists to create something new]].
