# considering the audience

Creativity is inherently human. When we create, we should consider who we are creating for.

Is it a form of self exploration? In that case, we are the primary audience, and we should give ourselves the most weight.

Is it for others? Then the audience should be considered. An example of this is [[design empathy]]. 

It is also true in something like filmmaking. We have a clear audience, and have to be conscious of what they want to see.

We must be careful not to consider the audience too heavily, though. If we only make things that the audience wants to see, we'll never make anything new, and [[people don't always know what they want]].
