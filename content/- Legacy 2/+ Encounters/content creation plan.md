# content creation plan



Intention:
Encourage personal growth in a practical, meaningful way.
Help people make sense of complicated ideas. 
Create an online education business that help people achieve that.
Discover and systematize methods of growing by striving towards my own goals.
Use individual pieces of those methods for content marketing.
Package methods in a sellable way.

Long form videos can be high quality deep dives or explorations of what I'm learning. 
Tell/Show the story of learning it. Answer my own curiosities. 

Short form videos can be a show your work style. More raw, less produced. Almost like a bts of life. Explain struggles of trying to put out what I'm trying to put out. I'll need to find a very *simple, sharable format* for this.

Courses, cohorts, drips, community, or whatever it ends up being, can be a culmination of what I've learned, packaged into a *digestible, reproducible method*. Really like the style of Hayden and Ramit and BMSU. 

Newsletter can be basically a journaling session. Share things I've found, ideas I'm thinking about, and what I'm working on.
Basically a combo of Godin, Abdaal, and Katie Xu.


What do I need to make this happen?
- Dedicated time for writing, filming, editing.
- A list of content ideas, curiosities, etc, to execute on.
- Newsletter setup?
- Release schedule for
	- Long form (monthly, preferably 2x/month)
	- Short form (2x/week)
	- Newsletter/blog (weekly)
	- Products

So what's next?
- Create batch schedules.
	- Ideation sessions (30 mins everyday)
	- Writing weekly short form. (2 hrs / week)
	- Writing monthly long form. (6 hrs / month)
	- Writing newsletter (1 hr / week)
	- Shoot short form (2 hrs / week)
	- Shoot long form (15 hrs / month)
	- Thumbnails for long form (2 hrs / video)
	- Edit short form (4hrs / week)
	- Edit long form (15 hrs / month)
	- Posting and launching (30 mins / unit)

Total monthly time spend: 100 hrs - 25 hrs / week - 5 hrs / day
**Create a calendar rhythm for this.**






How expensive would it be to go somewhere every month to ideate, explore, etc. Maybe stay like 2-3 days? 
Flight cost: 150-400 
Stay: 50-150 / night

300 - 700/month??


Maybe I should just try going close places first. Like coffee shops and stuff.
