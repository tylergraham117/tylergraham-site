# expectations are the enemy of happiness



I used to think that the enemy of happiness is ambition. My reasoning was that ambition requires one to desire either more or something different than the situation they currently find themselves in. Happiness is being entirely satisfied with the situation one is in. And since [[ambition is often driven by comparison]], I thought the curse of ambition was to forever leave us unsatisfied in someway. Therefore, happiness and ambition cannot coexist. The problem is that they do coexist, and often.

So now I think differently.

It is not ambitions, but expectations which are the enemy of happiness. 

> "Raise your ambitions. Lower your expectations. The higher your ambitions, the bolder your actions. The lower your expectations, the greater your satisfaction. Achieve more and be happy along the way." [[James Clear]]

By raising ambitions but keeping expectations in check, we avoid attaching our identity to our goals. We want to avoid this because [[attachment is the root of suffering]], at least according to Buddhist traditions. We allow ourselves to strive for a better life, to accomplish more, and be truly happy in the process.

> One of the best things a man can bring into the world with him is a natural humility of spirit. About the next best thing he can bring, and they usually go together, is an appreciative spirit — a loving and susceptible heart."

It seems that [[gratitude and humility bring happiness]].
