# focused action leads to presence

When you are [[monotasking]] and genuinely focused on the task you are performing, you get pulled into a unique state of presence. This is commonly referred to as [[flow state]].

If that is true, then if we want to experience presence, all we have to do is do something important and give it all of our attention. When this thing is meaningful to you, you'll naturally give in your full attention. 


This is one of the benefits of adventure. An [[adventure is both insignificant and greatly important]]. The importance, in this case, is the achievement of a state of presence, which we all often struggle to achieve otherwise. When we go an adventure, we become wildly focused within our arbitrary ruleset. And since [[acknowledging presence forces its conclusion]], this sort of focus is helpful because it distracts us from our own wandering thoughts.
