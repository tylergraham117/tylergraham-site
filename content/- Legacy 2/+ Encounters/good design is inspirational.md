# good design is inspirational

What makes good design inspirational?
 - What even is inspiration??
		- Inspiration is when we are stimulated by something into action.
		- There's usually some excitement,
		- Often by something we haven't encountered before (either completely new or in a new way)
		- Being inspired by the mundane is also possible, and is a muscle worth building.

[[all art is contrast]]

Good design is not only inspirational to those who experience it. It's perhaps most inspiring to the designer themself, because [[meaning is derived from intentional experiences]]. The process of designing something, with all the attention to detail involved, forces the designer into the moment, because [[focused action leads to presence]]. Designing something puts one in a [[flow state]].

In order to achieve good design, we must practice [[design empathy]].
