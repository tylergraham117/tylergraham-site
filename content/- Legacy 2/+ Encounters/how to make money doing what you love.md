# how to make money doing what you love



There are 4 levers in making money doing what you love:
1. What you love.
2. What the world needs.
3. What we can be paid for.
4. What we are good at.

If you're lost, define the 4 things. Make lists, look for crossovers.

What do you love doing?
What are you good at?

List all you can think of. Find the ones that overlap. That's your passion.

Now, which ones can you be paid for? 

Finally, what does the world actually need? Be on the lookout for opportunities in that space.
