# Imaginary Mentors

On mentorship/mentors:
Think about your problem. Write it in detail. Summarize it. Think about how your "mentor" or really anyone (be specific) would solve this issue. Now you probably don't need to ask the question anymore.


It's like imaginary friends when we're kids, except with mentorship instead of friendship!
