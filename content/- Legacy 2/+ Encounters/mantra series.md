Never orders, always favors (Sachs)
All people are different people (Ted lasso)
If you want applause, join the circus. (Goff)
Like you're running out of time  (Hamilton)
Nobody brags about moderation. (Penn Jillette, not a perfect quote)

Fate is a terrible writer. (Donald Miller)

The reward for good work is more work. (Sachs)

If you fail to plan you plan to fail.  (King Richard)

Time is undefeated (itzler)

Who are you becoming? (Roll)

I don't get tired. (Itzler)

Maintenance is a myth. Grow or die. (Hormozi)

Strong opinions, loosely held. (McGonagall)

For anyone trying to discern what to do w/ their life: PAY ATTENTION TO WHAT YOU PAY ATTENTION TO. (Rosenthal)

Do something until you can do something else. (Shonda Rhimes)

Inaction is an action. (Think of the trolly problem)

Confidence needs evidence. (We get a testosterone boost in the way of confidence when we earn it. Confidence without something to earn it will fall apart under pressure)

Dreams happen when you're wide awake.

Authenticity is overrated (in marketing- Seth Godin. People want something specific out of you. They definitely don’t want your excuses.) 

Generously persistent. (This is how you become a genius. Doing work that you think matters to the world, and not giving up when it doesn't work.)

Don't stop repeating yourself when you or your friends or loved ones get bored of it. Stop when your accountant gets bored.

People aren't double blind. (Placebos work, and the world isn’t controlled for them like an experiment is.)

Everything is a best of. (Rick Ruben)

Limitations are freedom.

Keep your tools organized and your materials messy. (John T. Unger)

When in doubt, tidy up. (Brian Eno and Peter Schmidt)

Leave things better than you found them. (Austin Kleon)

Measure what’s important, not what’s easy to measure.

Everything matters.

Break it. (That thing in your mind that's so perfect. Put it out in the world and mess it up. It won't be perfect anymore, but at least it's real.)

To be everywhere is to be nowhere. (Seneca)
