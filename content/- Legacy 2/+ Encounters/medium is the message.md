# medium is the message



[The medium is the message - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_medium_is_the_message)

> "**the medium is the message**" is a phrase coined by the Canadian communication theorist Marshall McLuhan and the name of the first chapter in his Understanding Media: The Extensions of Man, published in 1964. McLuhan proposes that a communication medium itself, not the messages it carries, should be the primary focus of study. He showed that artifacts such as media affect any society by their characteristics, or content.
