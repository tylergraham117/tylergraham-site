#### Introduction: 
- "A defining characteristic of all metaphorical language is that it is literally false. When we employ the metaphorical language 'time is money,' for example, we know that it's not truly the case, but it so perfectly captures our experience of time that we say it is figuratively -  as opposed to literally - true." 
	- In other words, [[don't let the facts get in the way of the truth]]. Metaphor is one of the most powerful communication tools we have. It's how we tell the stories that really stick. And it involves, by definition, literal falsehoods.
