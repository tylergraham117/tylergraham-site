# most activities don't have an end goal



Most activities in life don't really have a finish life.

We'd like to think of things we do in life as a clean story, a beginning middle and end and after that we start a new one. 

Growing up, I was told to [[finish what you start]]. I never really understood that because most of the things I was "not finishing" didn't really have a way to complete them. You either age out or stop doing it before that.

Most things we do do not have an end goal. We have to continue to work hard on that thing else we will become complacent and fall backwards into nothingness. If we would like to continue to participate in something, it needs to be 100%.
