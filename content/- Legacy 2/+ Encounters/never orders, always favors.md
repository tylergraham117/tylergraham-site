# never orders, always favors

There are two ways to exchange physical items. One is as a gift, and the other is as a commercial exchange. Each of these options has their own set of rules and cultural subtexts.

When money is exchanged for something creative, it becomes commoditized. This is not to say an artist cannot be patronized, but patronage is different. The money comes in, the artist does their thing, and the product is unrelated and not given to the giver of cash. In this case, the money is a gift.

Gifts can only exist without the exchange of money. If you pay for it, it's not a gift. 

Gifts have power. 

If I'm making something for someone, or even better, with someone, I do not like to accept money for it unless they came to me for the purchase. There has to be a line between the two. I think lots of people, including myself, overlook the power of gifts.
