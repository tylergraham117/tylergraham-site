# positive relationship between curiosity and knowledge

The more knowledge we have about something, the more curious we become. The more context we have in a given situation, the more powerful our [[natural inclination to resolve information gaps]] becomes.

This is powerful to know in storytelling. As we know, [[storytelling is about withholding information]]. As we release little bits of information, the audience's drive to resolve the knowledge gap becomes stronger, not weaker. 

[[JJ Abrams]] sees storytelling as the opening of "mystery boxes." By slowly revealing more information to the audience, we hold on to their curiosity longer. But once they know everything, they cease to care. This is because [[anticipation is more powerful than experience]] itself.
