# problem or situation?


When facing a challenge, it can be valuable to ask yourself: "is it a problem or a situation?" 

*If it's a problem, then there is a solution.* There are lots of ways to find a solution. Usually, it's obvious and we already know it. *The biggest hurdle here is that we often fail to act.* This is why it's important to have a [[bias towards action]]. Sometimes, asking others with an outside perspective is valuable for finding a solution. We might just be too close to the problem. Either way, problems have actions we can take to fix them.

If it's a situation, then there are no answers. Gravity is a situation. We don't try to fix gravity, because it's not a problem. It's just the way it is. We adapt to situations.

Whether it's a problem or a situation, complaining about it does nothing. The option is either solve or adapt.
