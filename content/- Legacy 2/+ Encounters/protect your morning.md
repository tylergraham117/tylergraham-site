# protect your morning
Ep1 in [[the energy series]]


Interesting sequence of waking up to phone alarm, then wasting a bunch of time on my phone.

INT Bedroom, asleep. Alarm goes off. I reach for the alarm, which is my phone, and turn it off. Then fall back asleep until the next one goes off. (Show that there's a bunch of alarms set somehow?). Eventually, wake up and scroll on phone for a while.

VO: 
If you're anything like me, you set about 19000 alarms on your phone each night before bed. Then, in the morning, you snooze them one by one, until you have a symphony of alarms blaring. 
Eventually, you shut them all off and wake up. But you're not really awake. You're the kind of awake that feels like you're still on a different planet. You're an astronaut floating through void with no connection to the spaceship that is your reality. You look around for some sort of tether to grab on to. 
And there it is. The very thing that brought you in to consciousness mere moments before.

*CU: Reaching for phone, looks like "The Creation of Adam" painting. Maybe even cut this into video.*
You reach for your lifeline.
