# story gives meaning to self help ideas



Reading fiction/memoirs helps with learning lessons and actually retaining them. You become connected to the story and it gives the message context. This is generally preferable to the narrative just telling you the message. Stories are bound to human nature.

All my favorite books with real long term impact on my life include some sort of narrative.

Similarly, [[art only matters with context]].

People understand the world through narrative.
