# the 10-10 rule

[[Where Good Ideas Come From (book)]] pg13

The 10-10 rule refers to how long it takes for the most important developments in mass, one-to-many communications to develop and reach mainstream use.

10 years to develop and build the new platform, and then 10 years for it to find a mainstream audience.

This was true for color TV, and HD, and AM radio. And VCR and DVD. So did cell phones, computers, GPS, etc.

It feels like as time goes on, there is both an acceleration in product releases as well as our willingness to embrace them. But apparently, even with that feeling like the case, it still takes just as long for new technology to reach mainstream adoption.
I wonder if the same will be true for AI and things like the Vision Pro. 

This rule was also true of software. The graphical user interface followed the 10-10.

YouTube did not follow this rule. It was more like 1-1. It went from idea to mass adoption in about 2 years, and it had to completely shift the paradigm of what it meant to watch a video.
