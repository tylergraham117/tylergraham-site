# the energy series
*Tired of being tired*



This is a series where I explore what makes us feel lethargic or energetic. The goal is for me to end up with more energy, and share practical tips along the way.

## Idea Dump:
- Track blood glucose with Levels
- Research why energy might be low
- Caffeine: how to use it and how not to (too much, too little, etc)
- Dopamine (and how everyone misunderstands it)
- Fruit until noon
- Post meal walks
- No phone after waking - [[protect your morning]]
- Fruit instead of junk food
- 15-30 minutes disconnect
- Heavy weights 3x/week
- Intermittent Fasting - [[the most important meal of the day is a lie]]
- Quit coffee
- Run first thing in the morning - [[running every morning]]
- Iodine??
- Stop procrastination
- Cold plunge/shower
- No phone before bed
- No eating 2 hours before bed
	- No more dessert before bed (what does this do to the body?)
- Caffeine delay
- 


Start with defining the problem: 
Specific encounter with the issue leads you down a path of discovery and triumph.




## Intro
*(MED: Centered shot of me going through life. Snorri Cam. Match cuts on face.)*
For as long as I can remember I’ve had this low grade feeling of lethargy. 

*(WI: Tracking shot of me looking like a zombie walking to get coffee)*
I’m just a little bit tired all the time.

*(Varied shots of different habits, some good some bad.)*
But the actions we take impact how we feel. Some give us energy and others drain us. 

*(CU: Pull gaff tape, write mantra on it.)*
In other words, "Mood follows action." (-rich roll)

*(More varied shots of habits)*
So I’m on a path to explore different ways to get my baseline energy levels up to where they should be.

**Save this, doesn't fit**
I have this distinct memory of being a kid sitting in the cafeteria at my school. 

We were all sitting there eating lunch, and then someone came up and asked “How are you today?”

I responded with “Tired.” At like 10 years old. 

And if he thought he had it bad, wait until he grows up.
