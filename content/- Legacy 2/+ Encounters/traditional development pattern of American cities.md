# traditional development pattern of American cities

A city is a solution to a problem. The nature of the problem that cities aim to solve is complex and adaptive. 

> *"Intricate minglings of different uses in cities are not a form of chaos. On the contrary, they represent a complex and highly developed form of order." - Jane Jacobs, The Death and Life of Great American Cities* 

Basically, within a city, the actions of everyone influence the sum of the city and it's individual citizens both directly and indirectly, resulting in a system that grows organically and works for (almost) everyone.
Rather than trying to plan for everything, which is impossible, the system is allowed to grow as it needs. 

The traditional development pattern and the more modern patter resulting from the [[suburban experiment]] is an example of a [[complex versus complicated system]].

Complicated systems have a lot going on, and there is much that is needed to maintain it. A complex system is adaptable and self sufficient.

It's like the difference between a natural forest and a monoculture farm. The natural forest is complex system, able to adapt and grow. The monoculture farm requires constant intervention, disease prevention, and resources. Even with all of that, it is still quite temperamental. 

Development patterns shifted because of money and restrictions, like [[zoning laws]].
