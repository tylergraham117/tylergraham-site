# use your space effectively

Using a space effectively is the basis of [[modernism in interior design]].


Most people waste a lot of space. To avoid that, I've come up with a set of rules for myself.

There are 3 types of object that can take up space:
1. Function
2. Non-functional
3. Storage

Let's go through how I define each, and what I do with them. 

**Functional** objects have a specific purpose. They are used for something that you do frequently. Most obvious examples of this are kitchen items, technology, etcetera.

**Non-Functional** items serve no functional purpose. These are typically decorative items, so their only "function" is to fill an area and make it look nicer. 

**Storage** items are things that are kept in storage for various reasons. Often, they are sentimental in nature. They don't add decorative value or serve any specific function in the space.


If we create a hierarchy of these categories, functional objects are at the top. Most of them are necessary, and some of them are not, but all of them have a specific use. Because of this, it's helpful to identify the use and make sure that use is unique to that object and cannot be done with any other. 

This separates our functional objects into:
1. Unique functional
2. Non-unique functional 

Ideally, we have only unique objects in this category, but there are exceptions. Unique functional objects are the top of the hierarchy. For obvious reasons, *we should like these objects a lot*. Spend the extra money to get the nice one. Make sure it fits your design preferences, performs it's task well, and won't break soon. These are the objects that make life easier. 

Non-unique functional items can mostly be discarded, unless having multiple serves a function. (Saving time by having multiple of something in different areas for example.)


Since we made sure that our functional items are also nice looking, our space should be decorated pretty nicely. Fill the gaps with non-functional items that feel meaningful. 

Storage items are mostly an unfortunate necessity. We keep them around because we spent money on it and can't get rid of it ([[sunk cost fallacy]]), or maybe it holds some sentimental value for us. It's alright to have some of these, but it's also important not to be so attached to them that we let them takeover our space. 

If the reason for keeping it is related to cost, either sell it or give it away or trash it. It's not doing anything for you and you're not holding on to the monetary value by keeping it. You're never getting that cash back.

If it's a sentimental reason, it may be worth keeping. It's important to keep in mind that [[the past no longer exists]], so what you're really attached to is the memory. Many [[people store memories in objects and people]], so keeping objects with powerful stories behind them is actually a reasonable practice. However, if these objects take up a lot of space, it may be best to just take a photo and keep that instead. It will invoke similar emotions as the reason thing.


So long as we engage in [[conscious consumerism]] and remain aware of what we own, all is well. 

It's important to be cautious of keeping too many things, because [[we are a function of our environment]]. If we keep clutter, we become clutter.
