# we are helped by what is not to use what is


"We join thirty spokes to the hub of a wheel, yet it's the center hole that drives the chariot.
We shape clay to birth a vessel, yet it's the hollow within that makes it useful.
We chisel doors and windows to construct a room, yet it's the inner space that makes it livable.
*Thus do we create what is to use what is not*."
