# we choose how we experience situations


We decide how we see the world. Jack Kornfield told a story on Ferriss about giving a presentation at the beginning of Covid, and explained how most people pay a lot of money for a independent meditation retreat but everyone self isolating during covid got that opportunity to do it for free. It was a joke, but I think on a more serious note, that's the power of perspective. Since [[everyone has a different perspective on the world]], we all get to choose how we see it.


The internal narrative we have going deeply impact the way we experience the world. This is impacted by beliefs, values, mood, etc. This is explored in "The Science of Storytelling" deeply.


[[we find what we're looking for]]
