# we don't like being told what to do




Instead, tell people who they are. - Bob.


I think this might be because of something like morality bias. We tend to think of ourselves are moral, just, and right. We think of others as a bit less so. This leads to an aversion to people telling us how to do things we think we already do better. The issue with this is that [[we can learn from everyone]]. Everybody's got something to teach if we're willing to [[pay attention to the world]] around us and the people in it.
