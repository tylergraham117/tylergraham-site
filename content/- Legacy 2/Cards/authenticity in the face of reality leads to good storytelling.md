# Authenticity in the face of reality leads to good storytelling

As we know, [[story is a character that wants something and overcomes conflict to get it]]. 

A [[story must have conflict]]. 

When we're trying to tell a story of something real, when we're documenting, we have to be willing to be vulnerable enough to show the conflict. If we don't, we're not storytelling, we're bragging or lecturing. 

While [[storytelling is about withholding information]], this is a piece we cannot withhold. In fact, the conflict should be front and center. The part we withhold is the resolution of that conflict. That's how we keep people engaged in the story long enough to see it end.

In life, it's [[not an adventure until something goes wrong]]. Similarly, it's not a good story without something going wrong. If the character gets what they want all the way through, we struggle to relate.


**However...**
It's not all about authenticity. If we've created some sort of brand identity, we shouldn't present *pure* authenticity, because [[authenticity in the marketplace is a myth]]. 

Take the example of a YouTube channel.  People don't show up for pure authenticity. That's part of the reason why vlogs don't work anymore. While yes, people want connection and personality, *what they really want is you to deliver them.*

A [[personal brand]] is consistency. It's what people expect you to be like. It's how they expect to feel when they engage with you or your content.






> "As a young twenty-something I was still nibbling at the edges of what it means to be a narrator, but surfacing was the idea that good storytelling is authenticity in the face of reality."

People experience reality as honestly as they can perceive it, so storytelling should follow that principle as well or it will feel false.


> "Trials of Miles made me realize that humans are - that I am - fallible, and this is an essential plotline to any adventure tale."

Stories must include human mistakes (or mistakes involving the character, this is the conflict) in order to display character progression.
