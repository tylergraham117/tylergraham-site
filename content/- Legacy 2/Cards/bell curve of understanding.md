# bell curve of understanding


I've observed that most experts in a field, while incredibly knowledgable, are able to recall and explain information really simply. 

Beginners also view that information very simply.

People in the middle find it very complex, complicated and confusing.



The sign of progress from being a beginner to intermediate is usually a bit of overwhelm. You know you've got a grasp on it when the fog dissipates and things get simple again.


A great example of this is Michael Pollen and his books on food relating to health.
It went from massive texts to "Eat food. Not too much. Mostly plants."

Alex Hormozi is another great example because of how clearly he is able to communicate complicated business ideas.

Jimmy of MrBeast went from lots of data analytics to, in essence, make content people to watch, and make the title and thumbnail super clickable.
