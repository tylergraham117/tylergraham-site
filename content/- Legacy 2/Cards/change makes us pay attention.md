# change makes us pay attention

To our brains, [[change equals danger]]. This is because our minds are constantly worried about our safety. The [[brain's primary mission is control]]. So since change equals danger, it also makes us pay attention to what is changing. Moments of unexpected change force our minds to pay attention because if we don't then we lose control of the situation and the brain has failed.

Change might actually be the only thing that makes us pay attention. If nothing is changing, then our brains kind of zone out. Since [[we don't notice our objective status]], we have to wait until there is some form of change, or [[situational contrast]], to arise, for our minds to start paying attention to what's going on.
