# Cognitive Bias


Every person creates a subjective reality based on the experiences they have had, emotions they feel, and their perception of whatever input they are currently experiencing. Since [[everyone has a different perspective on the world]], [[life is a subjective experience]], not objective reality, by which everyone bases their decisions, actions, and knowledge of the world on. This is to say that [[we are the culmination of our experiences]]. Because of that, we are prone to all sorts of cognitive biases. These are in effect coping mechanisms that the brain creates to simplify the complex world in which we live into something a bit more digestible, sort of like [[heuristic]]. 

Cognitive biases are not necessarily positive or negative, but they are often categorized as "hot" and "cold." An example of a hot cognitive bias would be something like wishful thinking, while an example of a cold one would be something like mental noise. This is helpful because it helps us recognize that [[we choose how we experience situations]].



**Resources:**
- Wikipedia has a "[List of Cognitive Biases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cognitive_biases)," which is quite extensive.
- [Pocket Biases](https://pocket-biases.glideapp.io) is an app which provides daily biases to research as well as a database of biases.
