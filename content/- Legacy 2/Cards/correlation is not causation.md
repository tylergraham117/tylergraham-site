# Correlation is not Causation


Just because two things are correlated does not mean there is a cause and effect relationship between the two. 

This is a common malpractice in the scientific community. I think it's important to keep this front of mind and be skeptical of cause and effect relationships. There is a lot more coincidence, randomness, and chaos in the world than we would normally expect. We want to explain things so badly that we're willing to accept untrue explanations.



How much correlation is needed before causation can be considered?
More realistically, correlation is a sign to look a little deeper. It's a thread to pull.
