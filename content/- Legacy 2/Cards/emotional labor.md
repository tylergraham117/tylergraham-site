# emotional labor


*Doing the work we don't feel like doing.*

Emotional labor puts you in a smaller category and makes you more scarce.

This type of labor is showing up emotionally when the work is hard. It's bringing positivity to the table when it didn't exist before.

How do we bring a level of care and humanity into our business? By caring more. By going above and beyond. By doing the maximum instead of the minimum.
> Consider the story of Zappos customer service


Examples:
- A server having a conversation.
- Small talk to customers
- Going out of your way to remember something about someone.

This is one of Jrnie's superpowers. Either it comes naturally or it's something she really cares about, but either way it makes a big difference to people.
