# forgotten life is equivalent to one that never happened



While is it not exactly true that a forgotten life is the same as one that never occurred, I think it is a useful [[heuristic]] to consider what it means to forget your life. 

To clarify, I don't mean a life forgotten by the general public. Every life's memory is lost on a long enough timeline. I mean a life which is forgotten by the person living it.

If we forget our lives, that likely means we failed to [[pay attention to the world]] around us. This means we failed to examine our lives. A forgotten life is typically one that lacks in purpose and meaning, and probably did not leave enough time for retrospection, because [[meaning is generally derived retrospectively]]. 

Since [[living a noteworthy life means living in a way worth taking notes on]], we can attempt to remember more of our lives simply by recording them. Writing is a great format to do this, because [[writing is thinking]]. This format forces us to more deeply consider our thoughts, dreams, ideas, and experiences. Other formats, such as video, provide different value. Video preserves life's moments in a way that is unmatched by any other. A [[video can evoke the same emotions felt in the moment]], or it can be altered to tell a specific lesson, because [[storytelling is about withholding information]].

The fact we have the opportunity to even create memories is insane because [[life is so rare and special]], so it is my opinion that we have a moral obligation to remember meaningful moments.
