# novelty slows down time



When we experience new things, it slows down our perception of time as our brain tries to make sense of what is happening. This is called the [[oddball effect]]. It is most potent when the experience is perceived by our brains as dangerous.

This explains why childhood feels so long. When we're young, we've experienced less of the world. Everything feels new. As we age, however, we have to look harder to find novel ideas or experiences, which leads to the feeling of the days flying by. Everything and [[anything can become monotonous]] over time. 

Trying new things often allows us to experience this slowing down of time. We should aim to do that consistently, because these experiences also tend to be [[peak experiences]] and leave us changed for the better.

When something dangerous happens, the brain slows our perception of time. In this same way, [[stories should stretch during times of change]] (danger) to build more suspense and include extra detail. Just as [[novelty slows down time]], so does danger. Often, things feel dangerous *because* they're new, not because they're inherently dangerous.
