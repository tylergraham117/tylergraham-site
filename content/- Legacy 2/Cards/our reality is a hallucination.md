# our reality is a hallucination


We have no access to actual reality. Everything we experience is basically a hallucination based on what out brains think our surroundings *should* look and sound and feel like, according on the information it gathers from our senses. 

But that's not how it *feels* as a living, breathing, conscious human walking around.

Instead, it feels like we're looking our of our skulls. We walk around, observing reality directly as we move through it. Apparently not. The reality we experience is actually a reconstruction that we experience in our minds.

Lets say you walk into a library. Your brain already sort of knows what to expect before you even walk in. When you do walk in, you look around. Your eyes process the light information that is then sent to your brain. Your brain merges that colorful, high definition image with the other sense, and combines it all into a more detailed hallucination. 

"Your brain is not directly experiencing any of that. Instead, your brain is locked in a vault of silence and darkness inside your skull." - Professor David Eagleman


This is why [[we don't notice our objective status]] and, more broadly [[objectivity isn't real]]. We are, in a very real way, detached from reality.

Everything we experience is filtered through our minds, which includes our the subconscious biases and lessons from past experiences that come along with that.

Since our reality is a hallucination, a reconstruction based on sensory information, its helpful to remember the fact that *our experience of the world might not be the truth*. We [[accept our visual environment as inevitable]], but it's not. 

Basically, [[don't let the facts get in the way of the truth]]. 

This is especially important to remember when other people are involved. If two people have clashing experiences, it can be easy to fall into the trap of fighting about them. We battle for who's right about the facts rather than trying to come to a consensus and get to the truth.  There's at least [[three sides to every conflict]] 

So why does this matter? Lots of philosophy asks questions that are so esoteric that we don't have any practical way of applying it to our life. Like Plato's chair. 

And this is actually related. It's in the realm of solipsism, the philosophical idea that only one's mind is sure to exist.



Our minds play a lot of different tricks on us, and most of it's survival techniques are ill equipped for the modern world. They're great at saving us from a bear, but not from a bad decision in a financial market.


Actual reality, whatever that means, is wildly different than what we experience each day. All of the sensations we experience are inside the brain.

The most tangible example of this is that [[color is a lie]]. 

Dreams feel real because they're made of the same hallucinated neural models we live in while we're awake. *And the same is true of a great story.*









> Solipsism (  SOLL-ip-siz-əm; from Latin  solus 'alone', and  ipse 'self') is the philosophical idea that only one's mind is sure to exist. As an epistemological position, solipsism holds that knowledge of anything outside one's own mind is unsure; the external world and other minds cannot be known and might not exist outside the mind.
