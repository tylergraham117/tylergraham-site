# pay attention to the world



In order to truly experience life, we have to pay attention to the world. Not just in the regular way, but really engage with it. 

In the context of creativity, this is crucial, because [[creativity is the processes of creating connections]]. You can't possibly notice connections if you aren't pay enough attention. A great way to do this is to take notes on the world. After all, [[living a noteworthy life means living in a way worth taking notes on]]. 

The value of taking physical notes is the disconnection from the internet. It allows you to pay better attention to the physical world around you. This is the [[value of analogue]]. 

Another way to pay more attention to the world around you is to travel somewhere new or do something different, because [[novelty slows down time]] and makes us more aware of our surroundings. 

New experiences help grow our unique perspective of the world, and new physical spaces are a great way to do this. Doing this can also force us into [[peak experiences]]. This type of shifting in physical location has not always been so accessible, so we should really take advantage of it. Unlike at other times in history, [[geography no longer shapes human civilization]] so strictly. It serves more as a guideline.

If we pay attention, the world will reveal itself to us. I remember on a trip to Colorado, I stayed at a lodge owned by a mountain man and his Russian spy wife. The mountain man, also known as Christopher, told us to drive up to this beautiful spot he knew of and just sit there for a while. Over time, nature becomes more accustom to you, and animals start to come back out. If you don't stop to pay attention, they'll just hide until you're gone.

Music teacher and conductorÂ **Nadia Boulanger**, who trained many of the leading composers and musicians of the 20th century, on focus:
"Anyone who acts without paying attention to what he is doing is wasting his life. I'd go so far as to say *life is denied by lack of attention*, whether it be to cleaning windows or trying to write a masterpiece." I pulled this from [[James Clear]]'s newsletter. The book he pulled the quote from can be found [here](https://www.amazon.com/Mademoiselle-Conversations-Boulanger-English-French/dp/0856356034).

Another reason to pay attention to the world is so that we may be aware of what our environment is like, because after all, [[we are a function of our environment]].
