# remember your life



A [[forgotten life is equivalent to one that never happened]].

Moments fly past so quickly, it can be overwhelming to try and hold on to every single experience. We should, however, try to write down as much of it as possible. Since [[living a noteworthy life means living in a way worth taking notes on]], we should be constantly excited to take notes on our lives. On what's happening, on who we meet and what we see. We should be jotting down random bits all the time. 

Conversely, I think some people think of their lives as not that interesting. These people, I would argue, are the people who need to try and implement this the most. Since [[we find what we're looking for]], if you set out to find interesting moments to take notes on, you will absolutely find them. It's not necessarily that you create them, although sometimes that's the case, but rather you [[pay attention to the world]] so much more deeply that you notice the meaning and excitement in the the things that have been around you all along because [[the mundane can be exciting if we approach it right]]. Life doesn't feel like it's moving so fast anymore because [[novelty slows down time]]. 

To help this along, we can use [[tools for memory]] to help us remember more of our lives.

On the flip side, [[we shouldn't try to remember everything]].
