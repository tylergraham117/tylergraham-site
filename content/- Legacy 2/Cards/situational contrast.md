# situational contrast

This is a phrase I'm coining to describe a moment of specific and unexpected change. 

Contrast is the difference between two things. 

So situational contrast is the difference in two moments.

Situational contrast is important because it is the moment that our brains go from autopilot to paying close attention to what's happening. This is because [[change makes us pay attention]]. 

Noticing these contrasts in life is important. There's a theory I've been thinking about that [[all art is contrast]]. I'm not positive this is true, but it seems to be.
