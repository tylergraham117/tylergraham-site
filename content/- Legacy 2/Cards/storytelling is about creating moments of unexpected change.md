# storytelling is about creating moments of unexpected change

A [[story is a character that wants something and overcomes conflict to get it]]. The conflict, oftentimes, within the story, is unexpected moments of changing circumstances. 

Change is one of the most important ingredients in a story because [[change equals danger]] to the brain, and therefore [[change makes us pay attention]]. In good storytelling, or writing, or filming, the goal is to create moments that would surprise and grab the attention of the protagonist, and therefore end up doing the same to the audience.

The "unexpected" part is important as well. In nature and in life, [[there is a rhythm to change]]. But introducing change outside of that, shaking things up a little, we're pulled out of our routine and start to experience life with a heightened sense of awareness. 

The newness of unexpected change sticks out to us because [[novelty slows down time]]. And it does so in a very real way. Our perceptions of reality when experiencing something new and unexpected are warped in such a way that out memories of that experience feel more detailed. It's almost as if we're able to process information more quickly in these situations.

There are lots of [[ways to signal change in story]]. In film, this could look like a vibrating rear view mirror to show someone or something chasing the protagonists.
