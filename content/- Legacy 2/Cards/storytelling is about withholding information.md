# storytelling is about withholding information


Human beings have a thirst for knowledge. We have a [[natural inclination to resolve information gaps]]. So, when we find a gap in something we can't quite understand, we get really curious about it.

This curiosity stems from a desire to understand and control our environment. The [[brain's primary mission is control]]. 

When we have a gap in knowledge, the brain tries really hard to fill that gap and complete a set of information. By withholding information from the audience, we create a sense of curiosity and anticipation, and [[anticipation is more powerful than experience]].

Good [[storytelling helps preserve moments of humanity]]. In doing this, many details have to be left out. If we include every single detail of a situation, the story begins to lose it's core meaning and value. In order to preserve the essence of a story, we have to make sure we [[don't let the facts get in the way of the truth]]. 

We don't need the whole world in our story. We need to be told specific parts of it that evoke emotion and take us on a ride.

Doing this lets us see the world differently. Since [[everyone has a different perspective on the world]], storytelling gives us a window into the minds and lives of other people.
