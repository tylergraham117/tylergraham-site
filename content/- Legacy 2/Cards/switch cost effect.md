# switch cost effect

The switch cost effect is a term describing the impact of [[multitasking]] on the brain. It states that each time we move from one task to another, there is clear drop in performance. This is because the brain has to reconfigure each time. 

According to an interview from [[Stolen Focus (book)]] by [[Johann Hari]], "technological distractions cause a drop in workers the IQ by an average of ten points." In other words, if you want to be smarter and more effective, just do one thing at a time. 

Every interruption lasts at least 23 minutes on average. This is the cost of switching your attention. 

> "A study by professor Michael Posner at the University of Oregon found that if you are focusing on something and you get interrupted, on average it will take twenty-three minutes for you to get back to the same state of focus." [[Stolen Focus (book)]]
