# time debt


> *"It's not about adopting a puppy, it's about owning a dog" - Seth Godin*

**Time debt is the time you owe something once you've allowed it into your life.**

It's easy to start something. It's easy to agree. It's easy to think somethings a great idea ahead of time.  *Until you have to do it.*

Lots of small additions to your schedule and bandwidth can easily fill you up.

Time debt is that of the bootstrapper, because [[every business starts with debt]].



#note/question‚ùì What is debt? It's owing someone something, but is that it? What are the impacts on the psyche?
