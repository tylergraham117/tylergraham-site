# transactive memory

Transactive memory is a concept coined by [[Daniel Wegner]] describing the phenomenon of storing out memories in the people we are close to. It's almost like a cloud storage system for our memories.

When someone close to you dies, it often feels like a part of you has died too. In a way, it has. All of your memories stored within your loved one is gone too.

I've heard stories of people who, after losing their spouse of many decades, were completely lost in the world. Once, I heard someone who didn't even know where to get a haircut because their wife had always done it.

My own grandma had no experience in buying a car, doing taxes, or basically anything financial, because my grandpa had always taken care of it. This is a little outside of the transactive memory definition and goes more into shared responsibilities, but the idea is similar.

"We don't just store information in our minds or in specific places. We store memories and understanding in the minds of the people we love. You don't need to remember your child's emotional relationship to her teacher because you know your wife will." - Malcom Gladwell (RH Podcast)

Maybe this is where the idea that opposites attract derives from. We try to fill the gaps that we ourselves cannot with another person that is better at whatever trait we lack.

The concept of transactive memory seems to go beyond simply letting others remember things for us. It seems that [[people store memories in objects and people]]
