# turn books into checklists

Instead of just reading, process the lessons you learned and turn it into a checklist that you can practically apply.

Just as [[self awareness will avail you nothing]], learning without application does nothing to improve our lives. 

So how do we apply what we learn? We take in the reading, derive clear lessons from it, and then turn them into actionable steps. In essence, we turn books into checklists.
