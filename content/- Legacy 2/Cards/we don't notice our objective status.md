# we don't notice our objective status

People tend not to notice their objective status. That is to say that nobody really pays attention to the way things are. Rather, people really only notice when things change. This is why [[anything can become monotonous]] if there are no significant changes.

We as humans quickly adapt to our given situation. Therefore, we tend not to notice the more intricate details of our current status, especially not in any objective way. We do, however, notice change quite well. This may be because we have to then adapt to a new situation, so there is more friction or conflict involved.

A change in status can be positive or negative. 

In the case of of a positive change, we can prolong the positive feelings associated with it by splitting the change into multiple encounters. A prime example of this is gifts. Rather than receiving a bunch of gifts all at once, we could split throughout the day and stretch the positive feelings across a longer timeline. This occurs because, by giving space between the gifts, our minds return to the baseline level of happiness on the [[hedonic treadmill]].

In the case of negative change, the opposite is likely true. It is probably better to get all of the bad out of the way at once, or "rip the bandaid off."
