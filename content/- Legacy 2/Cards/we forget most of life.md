# we forget most of life



We tend to forget most of our life. I believe an entirely [[forgotten life is equivalent to one that never happened]]. However, [[we shouldn't try to remember everything]]. In fact, our brains weren't designed for it. Most of what we experience is forgotten, and that's actually a good thing. 

Forgetfulness helps us sort all of the random experiences and information our senses absorb in some sort of meaningful way. It's kind of like telling a story. Since [[storytelling is about withholding information]], we have to leave a lot out. You don't need the details of everything going on in the world at a given time to understand the gist of the story, just like you don't need to remember every detail of every moment. We just need to get the gist.

Of what we do remember, we all have a tendency to alter the experience in memory. This is why [[everyone has a different perspective on the world]], even if they experience something at the exact same time. These altered memories are what get set into our long-term memories. Therefore, [[remembering an experience is a creative process]]. 

However, sometimes this memory forgetting goes a bit too far, and we end up not remembering moments that could've been special to us. To combat this, you have to try and [[remember your life]] as best as you can.
