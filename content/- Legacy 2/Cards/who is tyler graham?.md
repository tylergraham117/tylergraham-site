*This is an exploration into the character I am on screen.*


##### **Finding The Flaw**
- Prompts to find a sacred flaw:
	- The thing people most admire about me is...
		- Kindness
		- Open to new experiences
		- Often doing new things
		- 
	- I'm only safe when I...
	- The most important thing of all in life is...
	- The secret of happiness is...
	- The best thing about me is...
	- The most terrible thing about other people is...
	- The big thing I understand about the world that nobody else seems to get is...
	- The best advice anyone ever gave me was...


##### **Point of View**
*These questions help get a sense of biases and unconscious reactions the character might feel.*
- How do they experience their surroundings?
- What details to they hyper fixate on?
- What are they intimidated or threatened by?
- What are their goals?
- How do they talk to themselves? 
- How do they make themselves feel better?




##### **Creating a Characteristic World**
- How has their flaw led to material or career gains?
- How do they get an internal sense of heightened status from this flaw? How does it make them feel superior?
- What small moments of joy does it bring them?
- How has their sacred flaw brought them closeness with friends, colleagues, or lovers?
- What life goals has it generated? What achievement, in the external world, do they believe will make them happy and complete?
- What (if only in their minds) will they risk losing, materially, socially, or otherwise if they act against their flaw?
- How does their flaw make them safe? On the subconscious level, what do they ultimately dread will happen if they act against their flaw?
