# My Values ðŸ—º
A list of [[clearly defined values]] I choose to live by.

Clearly defining your values allows us to get one step closer to [[living our values]]. It's about finding what is truly important to you and what you believe in. 

The process of actually defining what you value can be difficult, and it changes over time. Our list of values is a living document. It's like our constitution. It's amended over time and grows as we do. It can be helpful to look outwards towards people we respect, but at the end of the day our values should be our own. 

A really great example of this is [[Benjamin Franklin's Thirteen Virtues]]. His values are formatted in list form, with a one word title of the virtue and a sentence or two of how that virtue is applied to his own life.

I'd like to categorize these at some point as well. 









--- **Legacy** ---

*I do quite like this idea, but I wonder if it should be simplified further...*
They are also quite vague and impersonal.

#### Format:
Value I want to embody > Personal definition > At least one practical action I can use to embody that.

### Love
Love is sacrifice and commitment.
When joy is a habit, love is a reflex. How do we become more joyful? Put others needs before your own. 

*Action*: Put someone else's needs before yours. Think about what they want in life, and help them get closer to that.


### Authenticity
Authenticity is willingness to be vulnerable if it displays a more true version of yourself.
When you are fully integrated, you show that version of yourself rather than building an image of who you want to be in the minds of others.

*Action*: Get clear on what you're struggling with and share that with other people.


### Passion
Passion is suffering for what you believe is important.

*Action*: Do something hard and uncomfortable, but important.


### Creativity
Creativity is connecting the world in meaningful and unique ways.

*Action*: Find the connections between things that don't seem to be there.


### Focus
Focus is being clear about what you want, and avoiding distractions in pursuit of it.

*Action*: Work in sprints. Give your mind time to wander. Avoid social media. 


### Curiosity
Curiosity is being in tune with our innate childlike sense of wonder and following it.

*Action*: If you are curious about something, dive deep.


### Connection / Community
Connection is forging meaningful bonds with people through mutual vulnerability and actions. (Share things that are hard to share, do things that are hard to do. Basically, go through hardships together.)

*Action*: Include other people in things you want to accomplish. If you're doing something, bring someone along.


### Meaning
Meaning is living for something outside of yourself, occupying your time with something valuable, and sharing all of that with others.

*Action*: Have a project, get outside of yourself, constantly be learning.

### Simplicity
Simplicity is stripping things down as far as they can go and retain full function, but no further. It's also having a deep understanding of the opposite, because less is only more when you know what more is.




### Contradiction
Contradiction is being able to hold two opposite yet equally valid ideas in one's head at the same time, fully understanding that neither is entirely true.




### Longevity
Longevity is acting in a way that prolongs the long term future.

*Action*: Eat well, exercise, share time with people you love, etc.
