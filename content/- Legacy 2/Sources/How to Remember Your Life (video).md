# How to Remember Your Life (video)


- Much of our life is forgotten
- Simple, mundane moments are often the first to be forgotten, but can easily be the most meaningful.
- Constructing a world of memories is something we have to be intentional about
- The paradox of digital photography is we take so many photos that we never actually look back through any of them.
- When you take a picture of something, your brain records less of non visual sensory information.
	- Taking photos makes us focus on the thing you took a photo of. 
- The key to remembering your life is deleting photos.
- Make sure your software syncs on phone and laptop
- Check your photos often, and delete ones you don't need to remember.
- You relive memories as we delete the photos
- Delete the photos that don't spark something in your mind. The ones that stay should be impactful enough to make you feel something.
- If you're editing RAWs, just export high res jpegs and put them in Apple photos.
- To capture a moment you want to remember, take a bunch of photos really quick, and then put the camera way. Let you brain capture the rest of the sensory information.
	- The photos serve as a gateway to the memories. They trigger the actual memories.
