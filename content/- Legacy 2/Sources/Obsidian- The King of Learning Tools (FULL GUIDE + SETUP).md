# Obsidian: The King of Learning Tools (FULL GUIDE + SETUP)



## Zettelkasten
- First, either consume or allow an idea to come to mind.
- Capture that. These are fleeting and literature notes.
- Connect those.
- Crystalize it into permanent notes.
- Create.


## System
1 - Rough Notes (Equivalent of scratch paper. I don't think I'll adopt this.)
2 - Source Materials (Sources, sorted by type in folders.)
3 - Tags (He makes tags through links rather than actual tags. Not sure about this. Would be a lot of work but probably makes the graph more useful.)
4 - Indexes (Tags are used as indexes too. MOC, basically.)
5 - Templates
6 - Main Notes (Atomic Notes. Everything together.)
