#### Introduction: 


#### Type History and Timeline: 
All fonts have been marked with **bold** within their time period for easier reference.

##### Fifth Century BCE
- Greek letters carved into hard surfaces are the first formal uses of Western letterforms.

##### Second Century BCE
- More modern Roman shapes and proportions are developed.

##### First Century BCE
- Roman monumental capitals are the foundation for Western type design, as well as the ancestor of all serif typefaces.

##### Fourth / Fifth Century CE
- Square capitals, formal hand-written letters that evolved from Roman monumental capitals.

##### Eighth - Eleventh Centuries
- **Carolingian minuscule** becomes the basis for the standard lowercase alphabet, thanks to Charlemagne.

##### Fourteenth / Fifteenth Century
- Johannes Gutenberg invents the printing press, which also creates the art of typography.
- Nicolas Jenson was one of the first printers to cut and use fonts based on Roman rather than northern European Franktur letterform. Revivals of this include William Morris's **Golden Type** and **Jenson Oldstyle**, released in 1893 by American Type Founders.
- William Caxton is credited with introducing England to printing and movable type. His most notable contribution in terms of fonts is **Blackletter**, which is generally considered the ancestor to **Old English** types that are still used today.
- Aldus Manutius, an Italian printer, commissioned Francesco Griffo to create **Bembo**.
	- They also are credited with inventing italic fonts. It's a common misconception that they did it to produce more inexpensive books. In reality, they did it as a marketing tool, to help sell books to scholars and government officials who wrote in a similar style.

##### Sixteenth Century
- Claude Garamond was the most distinguished type designer of his time, and perhaps the entire Renaissance period. He created **Garamond**, **Grecs du Roi**, and **Granjon**.
- Robert Granjon provided models for what would become **Plantin** and **Times New Roman**.

##### Seventeenth and Eighteenth Century
- William Caslon I created the Caslon Type Foundry. The first modern revivals of his work came out under the name **Old Style**. After the American Type Founders was founded, they changed the name to **Caslon 471**. Many versions came later, including **Monotype Caslon**, **Adobe Caslon**, and **ITC Caslon**.
- John Baskerville created **Baskerville**, one of the most popular serif typestyles. When he first tried to create fonts, he found that the printing technology was limiting, leading him to create his own press and ink. He created the hot pressing process.
- Pierre Simon Fournier, **Fournier**, created the foundation of Bodini's first designs.
- **Bodini** was an evolution of Old Style designs from Fournier.

##### Early Nineteenth Century
- William Carlson IV, great great grandson of the other Carlson, invented the first sans serif font. 

##### Mid-Late Nineteenth Century
- Morris Fuller Benton is responsible for designs such as **Broadway, Tower, Wedding, Alternate Gothic, Franklin Gothic, News Gothic, Century Oldstyle, Stymie, and Cheltenham.**
- Rudolf Koch created **Kabel**, as well as **Holla, Jessen, Marathon, Offenbach, Steel, and Wallau.**
- Lucian Bernhard created **Bernhard Cursive, Bernhard Gothic, Bernhard Tango, and Bernhard Fashion**, all of which are still available.
- Paul Renner created the first modern, geometric sans serif, **Futura**. 
- Oswald Bruce Cooper created **Cooper Black**, as well as some lesser known fonts like **Oz Handicraft** and **Ozwald** and **Highlander**.

##### Late Nineteenth and EarlyTwentieth Century
