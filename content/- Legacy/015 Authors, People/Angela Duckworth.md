# Angela Duckworth

Angela Duckworth is a research psychologist, author of [[Grit]], and co-host of the podcast [[No Stupid Questions]].

Angela has a firm grasp on psychological concepts and has a way of presenting them in a way that is uplifting and useful. She tends to give off a aura of positively when speaking, which is especially useful when her message targets one trying to better themselves through finding their weaker points.

Angela is the founder of [[Character Lab]].

In a podcast episode, Angela spoke about how her personality is largely distilled from her having to move in third grade. She was forced to create an entirely new social presence, and did so in the wake of some advice from her mother. She was told that if you like yourself and you genuinely like the other person, they will automatically like you back. And it seemed to work out for her. This is probably some sort of offspring of [[Self-Efficacy]].
