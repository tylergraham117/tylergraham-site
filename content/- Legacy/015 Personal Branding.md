Why do this at all?
I think there's probably a few reasons. I can talk a lot about some of the altruistic sounding ones, like wanting to share or help or teach what I've experienced, but I think it really comes down to status and a desire to make a career out of who I am, which is reasonable but insanely difficult.

Some of the things I would like to focus on in my online sort of life are:
- Youtube
- Newsletter
- Short form

The YT stuff is the most work intensive. If I can get consistent with that, and try to get more out of each unit of work, I think I can get this to work. 

Creating an audience and community around the way I see the world allows for clear alignment with anything I'd like to create. I want to get my personal needs met as quickly as possible so I can focus on growing things for the world around me. 

So what does the YT channel look like? More vlog style might be good, but with a story. Perhaps using the daily storytelling practice as a catalyst for a video could be a good way.

Topics for content creation:

- General thoughts on creativity
- Video creation
- Editing
- Photography
- Aviation
- Building/Making
- Health/Fitness



More about how I see and interact with the world. Avoid teaching. Just share a perspective that can be aspirational. 

Videos should be a storyline of me doing something, not a presentation. Bring people into a journey.


Creativity, curiosity, community. These should be the 3 pillars of anything I do.
