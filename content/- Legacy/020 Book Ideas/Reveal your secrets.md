### Quotes from the book

> "Step 1: Wonder at something. Step 2: Invite others to wonder with you."

A formula for becoming known.

> "The more open you are about sharing your passions, the closer people will feel to your work. Artists aren't magicians. There's no penalty for revealing your secrets."

I love this. You're not a magician, give away your secrets freely.
Wonder at unique things. Invite others to join you. Share your secrets.
Invite people into your process. [[Show Your Work!]]
