### Quotes from the book

> "In the beginning, obscurity is good."

> "...you learn that most of the world doesn't necessarily care about what you think."

People are busy. Attention is limited. To get someone's attention for any period of time long enough to understand your ideas is a gift. Until you have some reputation, nobody will be paying attention.


Use this obscurity to innovate, experiment, and play around in your creativity. Use this time to build your voice.
