### Quotes from the book

> "In my experience, it's in the act of making things and doing our work that we figure out who we are."

We don't discover who we are, we build it. We are a combination of influences and experiences and what we do with those. 
It's often an excuse that we don't know who we are yet. This is false, limiting narrative. We have to *do* to find out who we are.

> "We learn to write by copying down the alphabet. Musicians learn to play by scales. Painters learn to paint by reproducing masterpieces."

These are great examples of learning to find our voice through doing. We have to learn the basics to have a foundation to stand on. Then we can use our unique perspective to build on top of that foundation.

> "You don't just want to look like your heroes, you want to see like your heroes."

Learn to understand the lenses through which your heroes see the world. 

> "The reason to copy your heroes and their style is so that you might somehow get a glimpse into their minds. That's what you really want - to internalize their way of looking at the world."

By learning how they view the world, you are able to embody some of the characteristics you admire. You can understand the world how they do, at least in part.



### External Quotes

> "Those who do not want to imitate anything, produce nothing." - Salvador Dali

Without being willing to steal or imitate from things that inspire us, we will be forever stuck not doing anything.



### Other Ideas
 There's a difference between good and bad theft. Good theft honors, credits, transforms, and steals from many sources. Bad theft degrades, plagiarizes, imitates, and steals from one source.
