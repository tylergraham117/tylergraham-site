### How To Make A Video

The format could be something along the lines of an exploration into something, or a how-to of sorts, that ends up diving into a more philosophical idea along the way. The goal is to share my personal philosophical understanding of the world within the context of a more tangible experience. Ideally, the philosophical section of the video will lean towards the side of optimism for the world.

A story is a character who wants something and has to overcome conflict to get it.

###  Idea Phase
- The importance of community living space, why I like living with other people
- Work Hardening - How blacksmithing and life are related. Adversity leading to strength
- Agreeing and disagreeing should be off the table. It should be action or nothing.
- The 24 hour rule - If you want to think about something, give yourself 24 hours and then make a hard decision about it. No going back on it.
- LED Light building - Fixed vs growth mindset. Explain that even though these things look difficult, people can absolutely do it. Encourage and teach.
- The Doorstep Mile
- Talk good behind people's back
- Regenerative agriculture, farming, and how gardening in our homes is the solution to so many of the worlds problems.
- [[when luxuries become commodified]]
- Less is only more when you know what more is. (Collier)
- [[Moderation]] Nobody brags about moderation.
- Long hello, short goodbye. [[we choose how we experience situations]]
- Why do I make bread? (What's the value of making things yourself?) - Connection to food, fermentation, health. Cost? Satisfaction? Sense of purpose? When you make something, there is a real sense of accomplishment, and I think we all need that.
- Don't accept the default (overhead lights suck) - We shouldn't accept the default state of anything. People who used chrome were more likely to be successful. Maybe this can be a video about me redoing my office.
- The Dark Side of Ambition
- How to get healthy without a gym membership. (Discuss the blue zones. Design your life so that the healthy choices are the best option. Don't leave it up to willpower or even habit. Just make it the best available option.)
- Sprouting video. Talk about the ease, cost, health benefits, etc. Spotlight Doug Evans.
- Sharpen Your Knives - Tools are more effective when we take care of them. We should focus on maintenance more than we do.
- My theories on food and healthy eating. Start with the appendix story, we are not waking up with a stomachache and tell that whole story. (reenactment.)
- The value of reading (I refer to books for the big problems in life. I recognize that they are just someone's opinion and could be wrong, but people spend years of their life distilling all of what they know about something into a book, so I think it's our best bet.)
- [[brainwash yourself to accomplish your goals]]
- [[cutting corners while running]]
