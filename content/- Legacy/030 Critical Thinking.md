# Critical Thinking

To think critically is to judge the world based on facts rather than a set of subjective opinions. Critical thinking is a complex topic to understand fully, but generally includes an unbiased, rational analysis of ones perceptions through a variety of techniques and practices, typically conducted through self-directed or self-disciplined means. 

In other words, critical thinking must come from within and takes a look at the world through a more scrutinized lens, forcing one to think a bit more objectively about something.
