# Stories

Backlink: [[]]


I am going to write down every story I can remember and approximately date them as best I can.

Notes on the stories:
- Have an "I" budget. One is free, but make the rest of the story about "we," "us," and "our."
- Talk about things that people can relate to. Transition that into saying something important. Look at the story from a new perspective. Leave the story unresolved.
- Invite the audience into the story, but don't shove it in their face.
