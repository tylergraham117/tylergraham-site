## "And then what happened?" 

The four words that children ask when you pause telling them a story. The four words you hear at the end of a chapter. The four words, spoken or unspoken, that show you as a storyteller that people care. And then what happened?

Anything you can do to keep people turning the page is legitimate.

If you don't care what will happen, nobody else will either.
