### Notes

- Karma, after surgery, had a cone that shaped her sense of hearing. It altered her perception and she seems to only be able to hear what was directly in front of her. She didn't like it, but this may teach us something about focusing on what's right there in front of us rather than being distracted by all the sounds around us.
