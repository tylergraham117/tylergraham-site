I've used a gimbal for a lot of shots. Over time, I've developed some techniques that help get the best shot.

When you're shooting, you often only get one chance to get the shot right. Adding movement is risky, because it's easy to mess up. Our job is to minimize the chances of messing up. Here are some ways to do that.

### Prepare the Motors

When you're performing a camera move with a gimbal, understand which motors are being used. You've got 3, one for each axis. If you are doing a push in shot, it's likely that none of the motors are moving. For a pan, one motors is active. It's the X axis, following your turning motion. 

These motors have to sense motion in order to begin following. It's best to start moving BEFORE you need the shot to start, that way the motors know that motion is taking place. If you don't, you'll have a noticeable jitter in the footage when the motor realizes it's supposed to be turning.  

### Pick your Axis

Don't freestyle with the gimbal. Have a start and an end point. Understand which axis will be active during the move from one place to another. Then, perform that move smoothly. 

You can also have multiple points. These are more complex shots, but it follows the same principle. Move from A to B, then B to C. Don't pause between. Gimbal shots are all about fluidity, so we want it to feel like the camera is floating from one point to another.
