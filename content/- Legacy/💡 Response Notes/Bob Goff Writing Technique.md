# Bob Goff Writing Technique

We should have a limited budget for the words "I, me, and my." Instead, we should opt to use inclusive words like "we, us, our." This invites people into our stories and helps them see what they can learn from our lives. The point of writing for other people is for them to get something out of it. If you're writing and you don't invite people into the story, you're just journaling. Journaling is great, but it's not the objective here.  

### Steps to a good story:
1. Talk about something people can relate to
2. Say something important
3. New perspective
4. Don't resolve it

Invite the audience into a story. Don't shove the lesson into their face, but also don't hold it too far away. It's like a snack. You want to be at a good distance so they can choose to eat it if they want, not force it down their throat. 

Log every story that you can remember. Expand on it over time. This should probably be a habitual practice.

Bob is an excellent writer. His stories are incredibly engaging, largely because he is engaged with life. He pays attention and puts himself in incredible situations. 

In his experiences, he sees to always pull out some greater wisdom. Whether or not the stories are embellished, or if the lessons are fully realized in the moment is of little consequence. They are expanded in retrospect. He finds a way to make his experiences resonate with everyone. The above are some of the ways he does that.

I think the big one is to simply write down your life. The brain is terrible at remembering things, especially accurately.
