#mantra 

There are lots of reasons to do a thing. People do things for personal gain. They do things for status, money, power, reputation. They do things for personal satisfaction and moral values. 

Applause is a terrible motivator. Not because it's not very motivating, because it is very motivating. When we use applause, or praise, as a motivator, we change the driver of our work and values. It goes from an intrinsic motivation to an extrinsic one. At first, it works okay. Over time, it starts to shift and devalue the work you do. You start to try to please others rather than create something as a reflection of yourself. You start to act in accordance to how you think others want you to act. That's not very helpful.

If you want applause, join the circus. If you want to do something meaningful, look inside.
