# Addictive Behavior
#on/psychology 


By definition, addictive behavior has, or has the potential for, negative consequences to the action.

Addictive behavior is clearly related to the dopamine response. Dopamine is the brains primary chemical associated with pleasure. 

The general public often views addiction as the extreme addictions: alcoholism, drugs, etc. We can, by definition, be addicted to anything that causes a dopamine response and has a negative consequence on our life. In this way, sugar is often a fairly extreme addiction, but so can be procrastination or planning or anything disguising itself as useful but is actually pulling us away from taking positive action.
