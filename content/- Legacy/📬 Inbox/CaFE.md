This is an acronym for...


### Compression
Simplify something into one page. Only the important stuff.
This page can either be full of rules for the thing you're learning, or examples. Or make two one-pagers.

### Frequency
If you want to learn something effectively, make a habit of it and practice consistently.

### Encoding
Use tricks like acronyms, acrostics, and heuristics.
