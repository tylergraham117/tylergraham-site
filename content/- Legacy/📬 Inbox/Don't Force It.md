I love power tools. They can rip through almost any job in almost no time. Sometimes, though, the job requires a little more precision and finesse. For cutting wood, the tool for me in that situation is the Japanese style pull saw. It has a thin blade for cutting basically flush with the surface, and usually has two sides, which are used for different cuts. It's a simple tool, yet versatile.

When cutting with the Japanese pull saw, or any hand tool for that matter, the tendency is to want to push really hard and go really fast to try and keep the pace of the power tools we're all used to. The problem is, in doing that, the straight line you were trying to cut turns into a terrible curve. You notice it happening mid-cut and try to force it back the other way, but that just makes it worse.

I remember as a kid, whenever I was trying to rebuild something I'd foolishly taken apart, my dad would give me the same words of advice: "Don't force it." I often did not listen because I was (am) very stubborn. I usually ended up breaking the thing I was trying to fix. It seems counterintuitive, but often to accomplish something we have to try less hard at it.

The proper way to use a pull saw is to line the blade up where your line is and cut straight across the top. Then you just let gravity take care of the downward force. Just push and pull and a consistent rate and the sharp teeth will bite into the wood and slowly make their way through, straight on the line. 

It's a weird concept to try and get my head around, especially without personally experiencing it before trying. We all have a tendency to try and force things when all they are clearly asking for is less force. By allowing the natural forces of the world to do what they have always done, the pull saw makes the cut nice and straight.
