#on/consequence #on/choice 

Everything in life has a consequence regardless of whether or not that consequence is noticeable at the time. 

There is a consequence to living or working in a manner which is poor, mediocre, and excellent. The consequences to each of those are different. You have to pay the price of your decisions one way of the other. Which price do you want to pay?

Do things 100% or not at all.
