# Goal Hierarchy

The concept of a goal hierarchy is the idea that we all have large, overarching, mostly unwavering goals - especially if we posses any relatively high level of [[Grit]] - and smaller, more task focused goals that are quite fluid and easy to quit.

The goals at the top of the hierarchy tend to be more philosophical, more long term, and usually drive all other goals.

Going down the line, goals get smaller and become more task oriented and more flexible. It is important for these goals to be easily reevaluated if they no longer serve you. Basically, they should be easy to quit. 

I first heard this concept discussed by [[Angela Duckworth]] in [[People I Mostly Admire]] episode 32.

The #on/paradox in this is that you should simultaneously be hard set on your goals but also quit your goals all the time.
You should have high level goals that you chase ferociously, and lower level, task based goals that are quite easy to give up on.
