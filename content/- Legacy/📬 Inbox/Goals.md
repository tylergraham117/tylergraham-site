### What is a goal?
A goal is a desired future outcome. If the world is broken up into Cause and Effect Systems, goals are the effect. 

### How do we achieve goals?
In our cause and effect system, we've identified that the desired outcome, the "effect," is our goal. To achieve that, then, we need to make the "cause" happen. This seems oversimplified and conceptual because it is, but breaking it down in this way helps us realize that more things in the world are possible than we think, and the goals we have aren't as hard as we allow ourselves to think they are.
