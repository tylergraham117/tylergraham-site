[No Yes. Either Hell Yeah! Or No.](https://sive.rs/hellyeah)

This idea is about prioritization and choosing what is important. Basically, if something is exciting enough to get a "Hell Yeah!" response from you, it's probably worth doing. If it's anything less enthusiastic than that, then you should probably decline. 

This type of mentality can be useful, but should be balanced by the facts that we do not know what the future will hold, we should leave room for whimsy and ambiguity, and often we grow into our passions.
