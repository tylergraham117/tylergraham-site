The video idea here will be me creating a sleep journal while discussing the power of the subconscious mind. 

- The hook is something previously thought impossible, conscious action while sleeping. However, the actual video will discuss setting intentions before bed. 
- It's a sort of bait and switch with hustle culture and intentional living. Pull in the audience, but deliver with something useful and beneficial that they likely wouldn't have clicked on otherwise.
