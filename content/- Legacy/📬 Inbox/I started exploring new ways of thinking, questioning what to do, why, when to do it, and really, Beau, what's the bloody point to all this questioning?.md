"In the process of writing a PhD about adventuring and filmmaking, which emerged into a Freidian cross check of my ego, a certain form of antagonism arose, meaning I trust less, including myself. I started exploring new ways of thinking, questioning what to do, why, when to do it, and really, Beau, what's the bloody point to all this questioning? What a bore. Go back to doing something, anything, silencing the self-talk which digging, or curring wood, or weilding a hadn slasher as though you're a medieval warrior."
