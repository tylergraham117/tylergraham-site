If you want to learn more about something, experience it. If you can't learn enough from experiencing the regular version, make your own and really explore if deeply. 

This is what I took from Tom Sach's Tea Ceremony exhibit. There was also obviously a huge commentary on the differences between American and Japanese cultures, but it really struck me personally on that level of experience. Nothing holds us back from creating our own sandbox to explore something more deeply and fully. Tom Sach's was able to build his own tea house and really dive deep into what that ceremony entails.
