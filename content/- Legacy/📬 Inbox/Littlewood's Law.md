### From Wikipedia
**Littlewood's law** states that a person can expect to experience events with odds of one in a million (defined by the law as a "[miracle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miracle "Miracle")") at the rate of about one per month. It was framed by British mathematician [John Edensor Littlewood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Edensor_Littlewood "John Edensor Littlewood") in 1986.

We think one in a million events are super rare and will never happen to us, but really they occur pretty much once a month. We just have to be on the lookout for them and take advantage of the opportunities as they present themselves.
