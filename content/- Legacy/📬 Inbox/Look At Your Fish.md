It's important to look at things both widely and deeply. Width helps us achieve [[divergent thinking]], and thinking deeply allows for an attention to detail otherwise impossible.

"**Look at Your Fish**

One of America’s best biographers keeps a sign over his desk that says: “Look at Your Fish.”

His name is David McCullough and the saying helped him win a Pulitzer Prize. The story goes back to a 19th century Harvard naturalist named Louis Agassiz. He was a teacher. Legend has it that on the first day of class, he’d take a fish out of a smelly jar and drop it on the table.

Then, he’d say: “Look at your fish” and leave the room.

The students would say: "What is he talking about? It’s just a fish.”

After 20 minutes, he would come back and ask the students what they saw.

“Not much,” they’d say. It’s just a fish. It’s literally just a fish.

“Look again.”

Students were encouraged to draw and write about the fish. After a few days, students started to get it. Looking closer, they saw details they’d glossed over their entire lives, from the color of the scales to the texture of the fins. By the end of the semester, they saw how a simple fish was wondrously complex.

McCullough keeps a reminder of that story above his desk and uses it whenever he teaches writing because writers are really professional observationalists. They live in search of ideas that others miss because they don’t look closely enough. Insight comes less from doing crazy things that nobody’s ever done before and more from looking at what’s been on the table the entire time — right in front of everybody.

Look at your fish."
