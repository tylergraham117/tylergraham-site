# Mic Trick

The gold standard microphone for podcasts is the Shure SM7B. You've seen it in every single podcast everywhere. 

Here is the kit required to use the SM7B:

SM7B: $499
Cloudlifter: $179
Audio Recorder: Varied
XLR: Varied

So like $700-800. WHAT. THAT'S SO MUCH.

Here's an alternative.

The Shure SM57. 

This microphone is a classic in the music world. This thing has been used forever to record instruments, vocals, everything you can think of. It's a super versatile mic with practically the same hardware as the SM7B. 

The difference? Marketing.

The SM57 is marketed towards musicians. The SM7B is marketed towards podcasters.

That's literally it. 

With a little bit of audio magic you can achieve the same sound for - get ready - $99.

No cloudlifter, just an XLR cable and an audio recorder. If you want it to look cool like the other one (because let's face it that's a big reason why we all want that one), you can throw foam pop filter on there and it's basically the same thing. 

Here's a video to a guy that knows a lot more about microphones than I do.
