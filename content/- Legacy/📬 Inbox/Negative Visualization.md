# Negative Visualization

Negative visualization or futurorum malorum præmeditatio is a method of meditative praxis or askēsis by visualization of the worst-case scenario.

In modern stoicism, Negative Visualization is a stoic concept that involves considering worst case scenarios consistently. For example, thinking of three things that could have easily gone bad to you on a given day, but did not. It is a practice of gratitude and tends to make one understand at a very practical level that things could be much worse and we should be thankful for everything that we have.
