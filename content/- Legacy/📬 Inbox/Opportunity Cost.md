# Opportunity Cost

Opportunity Cost is an idea in economics which states any capital spent on something costs both what you spend on it as well as any gains you could have obtained by spending that money elsewhere. 
For example, if you buy a fancy expensive car, but could have invested that money, then the car costs what you paid for it, as well as what you did not make from the potential investment.
Everything has an opportunity cost, and it is important we be mindful of this when making decisions.


This concept is equally useful regarding our time spent on something. Or any resource for that matter. Time spent on one thing could have been just as likely spent on another, more useful activity.
