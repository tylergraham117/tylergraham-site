The PARI framework is a way of setting and achieving goals.

Pact
Act
React
Impact

### Pact
Pact is where you set a goal. The goals should be specific but fluid. Don't include minimum amounts of effort because you will likely make it unachievable to yourself long term.

### Act
Act is doing the thing. Some sort of progress needs to be made. The only thing you can do that's wrong is nothing.

### React
This is a response to what you've done so far. Review your progress and react to it. Create something based on what you've learned.

### Impact
Have a more long term goal or project in mind to sustain motivation. Think [[Goal Heirarchy]] here.
