[[Race]]
I'm a white guy that grew up in a suburban town in Texas. Throughout life, in respect to race, I experienced zero negative consequences of existing as such. 

My group of childhood friends is composed of 8 people. The racial pie is sliced as follows: 3 white dudes, 3 black guys, 1 asian, and 1 hispanic. 

The other night, a most of us, with our significant others, were at Charles's apartment. The topic of racial injustice, specifically in regards to the black experience in America, arose. I was the only white person in the room. Obviously, with the topic at hand, the historical bad guy is the white American. The atrocities committed over the American experience are second to none in recent history and their effects ripple into the present day. I was honored to be included in this conversation. I had no right to be there and had nothing substantial to contribute. I have no way of understanding some of the feelings that I heard my friends express. 
What was surprising to me is that, while growing up adjacent to all of the different hardships they faced, I was never aware of them. I think that is both due to circumstance and a level of ignorance. 
Regardless, I think growing to understand these struggles and finding some sort of actionable way to do something about it is an important part of my story going forwards.
