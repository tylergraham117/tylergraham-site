Since the birth of our nation we have experienced laws relating to or created because of race. All of these laws seem to be in favor of white skin color.
Because of this, it was beneficial to be white. This led people to attempt to be considered white regardless of the truth of the matter. Over time, this lead to a disregard for actual cultural roots, and the balanced tipped from caring about family past to simply caring about skin color. This process was dehumanizing in a way, leaving people as shells of their historical context, forcing them to cling to whatever they had left, which, in their case, was power. In clinging to power, they became dependent on it. Now, in an era where equality is becoming closer to reality, these people feel that power slipping. This is where the backlash comes from. It also explains the adverse reactions to these movements I've seen in people of color, because they've attached race to class, and they want to see themselves as a higher class than those fighting for what is right.
