# Sidney's Community of Creators

### Why Does This Exist?

Being a creator can be lonely. It's hard to find like minded individuals, and we spend hours alone working on the things we care about. Often, friends and family don't quite understand what we're trying to do, and they definitely can't contribute.

The issue is that the most creative ideas often come from collaboration. 

There are so many creative people out there. We just have a hard time finding each other because we're too busy actually creating.

This community exists to bring creatives to a central place where we can collaborate, inspire, and learn from one another.

### Path Outlines

**S**ubject  
**P**eople’s Stories  
**A**ction  
**R**esult  
**K**nowledge    
  
**Subject**—Picking a compelling topic for your course is key. You can pull from your own personal experiences, something you’re curious about learning, or an area that’s grabbed your attention from other communities.   
  
**People’s Stories**—Always pair your subject with some relevant, real-world examples of peoples’ stories.   
  
**Action**—Turn your course into an active experience by offering a weekly challenge that gives your members hands-on experience with your topic.   
  
**Result**—The result is the one thing you want your students to walk away with at the end of your course. (Hint: Ask yourself what your course is _unlocking_ for your students.)  
  
**Knowledge**—Knowledge is about more than just a single result. It’s about everything they’ll learn on the journey. And, again, because of the community component, they’re going to learn things you may not even know yet.
