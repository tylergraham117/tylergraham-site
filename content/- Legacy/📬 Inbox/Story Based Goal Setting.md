### How it works
Story based goal setting uses [[aspirational identity]] and [[Self Image]] to achieve goals. One the of the driving forces behind human behavior is the opening of a [[Story Loop]]. When we do this, our brains have the innate drive to close the loop. 


### Cognitive Dissonance
We can use the power of [[cognitive dissonance]] to achieve goals. In simple terms, we become who we tell ourselves we are.
For example: If you say "I am bad at waking up early" then that belief remains true. If you say "I am good at waking up early" over time the brain will try to bridge the gap and make that true. It's the concept of [[Limiting Beliefs]] put to action.
Use this to create a better version of yourself.



What old characteristics are you hanging onto that don't have to be true anymore?

Our self image wants to be congruent with reality.

Reinforce characteristics that you want to have.

> How do we reinforce these characteristics without allowing it to impact our ego?


Aspirational identity: who do we want to become. 
This needs to be very specific. 
[[aspirational identity]] is subconscious, powerful.
Often used in marketing.

You will become the person you believe you are, so long as that description is specific. 
Who do you want to be? 


We are designed to change over time.
People who complain or struggle with the same things over a long period of time are wasting their lives.

Have a 10 year, 5 year, 1 year vision of yourself. This is not goal setting, its describing who you are in those time periods. Who do you want to be, not what do you want to do.

If they made a movie about the character you are in 10 years, what's it called? 5, 1 year. These are smaller aspirational identities.


Life Planner (daily routine, takes about 15 minutes):
- Obituary
	- How do you want to be seen on the day you die?
- 10 Year Vision
	- Health
	- Career
	- Family
	- Friends
	- Spiritual
	- 2 things I try to do every day (meditate, exercise, etc.)
	- 2 things I do not do (reject unwanted feelings, speak negative about others, etc)
	- Life Theme
- 5 Year Vision
- 1 Year Vision
Reading this consistently allows us to change without significant effort.

We are designed to change over time. That change is shaped by our circumstances, but we can pick the direction. It's like a river, and who we want to be is the gravitational force pushing the flow downstream.
