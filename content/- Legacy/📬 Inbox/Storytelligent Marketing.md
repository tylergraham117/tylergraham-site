## Story Branding Levels 
1. Your brand is just what you do. SB7. What problem do you solve for your customer?
2. Your brand has an identity. People begin to associate the brand with certain things. There's also an identity surrounding the types of people who are involved in the brand as customers.
3. The marketing itself becomes a product. People begin asking you to create more of your marketing content. 
4. Philanthropic marketing. Your brand's marketing is so powerful that it can enact change on the world. 
5. Iconic. These are the biggest brands in the world. Marketing does not lose value, but you must keep it going. Your audience will begin creating content around you. 

Awareness, lifestyle, product, philanthropic, iconic.

Brand storytelling is less useful for transactional, one time customers.
