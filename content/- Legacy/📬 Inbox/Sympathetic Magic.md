# Sympathetic Magic
1.  primitive or magical ritual using objects or actions resembling or symbolically associated with the event or person over which influence is sought.

The artist [[Tom Sachs]] uses this idea in his art by creating symbolic object and recreating rituals or proceedures of complex systems, cultures, or actions. For example, his NASA exhibits tend to try to be as close as possible to an actual space mission as they can possibly be, likely with the intention of recreating some of the discovery and wonder behind space travel.

The idea of sympathetic magic, at least in the way Sachs uses it, really seems to speak to the idea of doing the best you can at something at the time you're doing it, and what you want may present itself in a way you cannot currently conceive.

This is evident in the Cargo Cults. Upon seeing planes bring supplies to their island, the people tried to worship and summon the planes back through the use of home-made runways. Eventually, the absurdity of their actions caught the attention of the world, so planes did actually come. On the surface, to the people of the island, it would seem what they did actually worked. But, with our outside perspective, we can obviously see that [[correlation is not causation]].




Genuine fake. Make something that inspires you in your own way.
