The 40% rule is the idea that the human body is much more capable than we can possibly imagine. This idea was originally coined by David Goggins when he was ultra running a lot. 

Basically, the rule states that when we think we can't possibly go on anymore, we're just totally wiped out and gone, we're really only tapped in to 40% of what our bodies are actually capable of.
