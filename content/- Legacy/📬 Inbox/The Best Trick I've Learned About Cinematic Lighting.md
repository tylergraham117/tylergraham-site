# The Best Trick I've Learned About Cinematic Lighting

We all know lighting is important. Recently, however, I've decided that it is the *most important* element of the visual side of filmmaking/content creation. 

Your color grading is important.
Your lens is important.
The camera you use is important.

None of this is as important as lighting. Lighting is the foundation of your shot, upon which the other pillars sit.

We know this is true definitionally because without lighting, there is no shot. Light has to hit the sensor of your camera in order to create the image we see. Without good information reaching the sensor, there is no hope for creating a good image.

Everyone wants to get some nice "cinematic" looking footage. 

But how? Lighting is so complicated! There's so many kinds of lights and diffusers and negative fill and what's the difference between a key light and fill light again?

And all of that's true. And important. But in a pinch, this is my favorite thing to lean on:


When you go onto your set, put your subject between the main light source and your camera. Make sure the light source is a little off to the side. Now, if necessary, and it probably will be, put a light on that same side as the other light source but this time lighting their front. That's it. Back light (practical), key light.
