"Never enough time to do it right, always enough time to do it over." - Alan

Nurturing biodiversity seems to answer all problems, but it takes time.

Everything that exists seems to have a role in nature. We've broken everything up so much that the interconnectedness is failing, so it's now our job to figure out what the roles are and put everything back together.

If you talk about your dreams, the world will conspire to help you.

Lots of the best stories seem to start when people try to do amazing things that they're in no position to do. (Can't afford it, not enough expertise, etc.)

Solve problems through observations and creativity.
