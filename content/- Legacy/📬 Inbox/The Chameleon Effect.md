# The Chameleon Effect

The Chameleon Effect seems to reference the phenomenon quite clearly evident in human behavior where people tend to unconsciously mimic those around them. Apparently, this is thought to have evolved as some sort of survival mechanism, although it is mostly unclear as to why. Many primates do this too. Noteably, chimpanzees mimic each other, but far less severely. Humans are thought to fall prey to [[Over-Imitation]], basically imitating the exact actions of those around them, while other animals imitate in a more conceptual manner, allowing them to discover things on their own. It seems the saying "monkey see monkey do" is actually even more applicable to humans than monkeys.
