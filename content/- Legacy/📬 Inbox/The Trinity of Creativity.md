# Trinity of Creativity
#on/creativity 

Creativity is serendipitous and allusive, but we can do our best to try and spark it when necessary. Some of the best ways to do this include:
- Movement
	- Movement provides novelty of experience and a sense of forward progression.
- Leisure
	- This switches the context your mind is perceiving the world with and allows you new perspective.
- Sleep
	- Sleep helps us tap into our unconscious minds, which is a much better problem solver than the conscious one.

By taking advantage of this trinity, we can get ourselves out of a rut or stop ourselves from getting there in the first place.
