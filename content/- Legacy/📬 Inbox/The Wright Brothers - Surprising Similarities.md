**The Wright Brothers: Surprising Similarities**

The Wright Brothers are known for their aviation prowess, but they started as bicycle repairmen. They owned a shop in their native town of Dayton, Ohio. As one friend said of them: “Bring up the subject of the shapes of handlebars or types of pedals on early ‘safety bicycles’ and his whole face lights up.”

Later, they applied intellectual curiosity to building airplanes. From bicycles, they learned to build strong but lightweight structures. Like a bicycle, balance was central to early airplanes. In the Wright Brothers’ early design, the pilots turned the airplane by shifting their balance. Rolling right or left caused the airplane to turn, similar to the way you turn on a bicycle.

Distinct projects can be surprisingly similar.

Today, my favorite example is Rich Barton, the founder of Expedia, Zillow, and Glassdoor — a $21 billion travel company, a $23 billion real estate company, and a $1.6 billion recruiting company. But as Kevin Kwok shows in [this article](https://click.convertkit-mail.com/qdud5zmv36u7h9r76zcl/08hwh9hmd0lozgil/aHR0cHM6Ly9rd29rY2hhaW4uY29tLzIwMTkvMDQvMDkvbWFraW5nLXVuY29tbW9uLWtub3dsZWRnZS1jb21tb24v), he used the same philosophy to build all three companies. All three industries were clouded by information asymmetries. He used the Internet to transfer power from incumbents to ordinary people: "Glassdoor revealed how employees really felt about companies. Zillow shed light on what any house was worth. Expedia let people see the prices and availability of flights and hotels without talking to an agent.”

From Barton and the Wright Brothers, we see how one way of thinking can apply to various fields. What looks like an insane leap to others can feel like a small step to you.
