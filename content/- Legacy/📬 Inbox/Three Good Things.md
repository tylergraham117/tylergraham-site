# Three Good Things
This is an exercise proposed by the [[Character Lab]], a non-profit owned by [[Angela Duckworth]]. 

The exercise involves simply listing three good things that happened to you, and explaining why those things happened. 

In essence, it is a [[Gratitude Journal]]. It deviates from that in that this exercise requires listing things outside of our [[Locus of Control]].

The idea is that, when you do this habitually, you start to look for things to add to the list every day. [[we find what we're looking for]].
