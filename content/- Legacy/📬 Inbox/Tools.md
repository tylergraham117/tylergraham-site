# Tools


We, as humans, make tools. These tools return the favor by making us. What I mean is that we are quite useless without our tools. We evolved useful brains and pretty much useless everything else in the grand scheme of things.

If we have tools that we aren't using, we are doing the tools and ourselves a disservice by making both things less useful.

I want to show this by laying out all the tools at my disposal and go through their various uses.

I will talk about the symbiotic relationship between man and tool, and explain why this is something that we should more consciously and intentionally respect. Tools are important and are usually made for a specific purpose. Some go beyond their original purpose, with people using them more creatively than their maker could originally anticipate. I want to find out if I have any such tools, or if any tools I posses have other users who do so.

[[we are a function of our environment]]
