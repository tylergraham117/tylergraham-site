Type two fun is a concept I originally read about in a book by Alastair Humphreys. He explains that type two fun is more of a slow burn, delayed gratification kind of fun that really mostly manifests in a deep sense of satisfaction. Generally, this type of fun is accompanied by lots of pain, suffering, mundaneness, or anything else that would normally be considered anything but fun. The only way it becomes fun is when it is earned and satisfying.
