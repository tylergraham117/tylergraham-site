Unwinding the complexities of human behavior through the study of history brings a sense of clarify that manifests in a way that makes so much of life feel trivial, and the rest inconceivably crucial.

Said another way, by diving into the depths of our history, we gain a perspective on human behavior that makes it seem as if most of what we do is pretty unimportant. The remainder of that behavior can then be seen for what it is: imperative to our existence.
