- No Stupid Questions - "Are Women Required to Be Nicer Than Men?"
- Apparently, the dominating framework for social judgement is based on how warm and competent we view the other person.
- Gender difference based on warmth
	- Women must be seen as both competent and warm to seem confident, whereas men need only to seem competent.
	- Possibly related to an expectation based on women's innately higher levels of empathy.
	- Are these differences derived from evolutionary happenstance (women were necessary caregivers at a point and therefore developed higher baseline empathy) or perhaps a circumstancial developement based on culture?
		- Almost like a tactic for survival in the modern societal norms.
