There is apparently an entire culture based around the existence, growth, and nutritional benefits of watermelon. It seems that the central hub for this community is located at https://www.watermelon.org. 

They have crowned [Paige Huntington](https://www.instagram.com/nationalwatermelonqueen/?hl=en) as National Watermelon Queen. Paige lives in Tyler, TX. 

This is an absolutely fascinating thing to exist and I'd love to learn more about it.
