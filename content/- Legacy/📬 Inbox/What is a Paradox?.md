Backlink: [[050 Paradox]]

A paradox is generally understood as something that is seemingly self-contradictory but upon further investigation proves itself to be correct.
> 1. a seemingly absurd or self-contradictory statement or proposition that when investigated or explained may prove to be well founded or true.

So, in essence, a paradox is something that seems to contradict itself, but actually holds truth or value that can only be understood after proper consideration of the subject. I find this topic intriguing because I seek to better understand the world in which I live, and to do so I must better grasp the intricate  complexities of it. 

The paradox is one of such complexities that I have noticed come up rather frequently in life and in literature, which alone proves it merits some further investigation. Furthermore, according to the definition of the word, a paradox requires digging deeper to really understand its truth. Hopefully in doing so for myself, I will be able to do this for other people. I think that understanding the worldâ€™s paradoxical, dualistic, self-contradictory nature is a key to binding humanity a little bit closer together.
