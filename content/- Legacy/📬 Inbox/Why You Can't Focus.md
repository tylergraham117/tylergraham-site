# Script


The world is speeding up. 

We all want more. More money. More followers. More time. More things. 
And we want it faster. Faster delivery. Faster news. Faster information. 

You only live once, so we have to hurry up and do everything we want to do, get everything we want to get, as fast as we can. 

Right?

Well, no. This pursuit of more, faster has left us in a world full of distractions.  

And in a world full of distractions, our lives are diminished. We're not at our full capacity. 

If we can't focus, we can't achieve what we want to achieve, do what we want to do.

And in a world like that, one of the first casualties is joy. 


So why are we so distracted? What's going on here? 

Well, it turns out that we've accidentally created an almost perfect environment for destroying our ability to focus. 

But to win the fight against distraction and restore our ability to pay attention, let's just back and find out what the heck that even is. (rewind)


In his book Stolen Focus, Johann Hari explains that there are a few different layers of focus. 

The first is the one we usually think of when we think of attention. He calls this "spotlight" focus. 
It's the ability to pay attention to something selectively. Things like immediate actions. 
"I am going to read."
"I am going to edit this video."
"I am going to make this coffee and not forget about it again."
Stuff like that. This type of focus is all about narrowing down your attention.

The second layer is "starlight" focus. This is a wider focus, a more long term approach to the world. 
"I want to start a company."
"I'm going to write a book."
"I'd like to move to a different country."
Longer term goals require longer term focus. If you get thrown off by life, you can look up at the stars and remember where you're supposed to go. That's why he calls it starlight.

The third layer is "daylight". This form of attention is the prerequisite for self awareness. It allows you to know what you want out of life.
"How do you know you want to run a business?"
"Why do you want to climb that mountain?"
"What does it mean to be a good person?"
This type of focus lets you see your environment clearly and figure out who you are, what you want, and what to do to get it.

The fourth layer is "stadium lights". This is our ability to focus on each other. It's how we are able to collaborate and work together for collective goals. This is the type of focus required to build a better world. Focus isn't just an individual issue, it's a societal one.


On April 7, 1964, IBM announced the IBM System/360. Along with the computer, they released a paper describing it's functions. This paper was the first even published use of the word "multitasking." It described a process where the computer would maximize it's processing capabilities, saving time. It works by essentially overlapping tasks, allowing the processor to execute segments of lots of tasks in a way that was woven together.

So the word multitasking was originally coined for computers. 

But us people, always wanting more, took that term and tried to apply it to ourselves.

We thought, "Hey, we should do a bunch at the same time too. It'll save us time!"

The reality is there are significant costs to multitasking. 

The big one is the switch cost effect. This is sort of like a tax we pay to switch our focus from one thing to another.

A variety of studies have been done on this effect. 

One described a an IQ drop of ten points in the average worker. 

Another explained that every time our attention is switched or interrupted, it takes na average of 23 minutes to the same state of focus you were at before.

This means that every time your phone goes off while you're trying to focus, it's not just a quick text. It's a 23 minute long detour.

Another price of the switch cost effect is a reduction in creativity. 
Since creativity is the processes of creating connections, we have to give the brain time to do that. If we're constantly overloading out minds with switching between tasks, the brain has less time to create these associations. 


Which brings me to the next cause of our attention deficit: The disruption of mind-wandering. 

This is a crucial part of the human experience. 

It's where we allow our subconscious mind to take over and explore new ideas and new connections. 

Mind wandering feels a lot like being bored, but that's not a bad thing. It's a necessary component of a healthy mind. 

I personally really struggle with this one. I feel a constant need for inputs. 

I feel like if I'm out walking, I should also be listening to a book or a podcast so I can optimize my time. 

Apparently this logic is flawed, and I've been trying to avoid this sort of thing more and more recently. Thinking like this harms my creativity, and leaves me overwhelmed more often than I should be.

The more your mind gets to wander, the better you are at organizing personal goals, being creative, and making long-term decisions. 

An important note is that mind wandering is best experienced in low stress, safe environments. If you're in a high stress or dangerous environment, mind wandering often leads to anxiety.



Focus can be thought of on a sort of spectrum. 

On one side, we have the fragmentation of our attention. Fragmentation forces our thoughts to be shallower, angrier, and less useful overall.
On the other side, we have flow. Flow makes us feel calm, present, and filled with purpose.

You've probably heard of flow. It's often thought of this hard to reach place where your focus is so intense that you start floating.

What you might not know is that there's a recipe for flow, and it's not even that complicated. 

Basically, a flow state is the result of having a clearly defined goal that is meaningful to you, and is right on the edge of what you are capable of, but not beyond. (flow = clear goal + meaningful + challenging)

Everything you do brings you closer to either fragmentation or flow. It's always a choice. 

We can choose fragmented focus and multitasking, or we can choose monotasking and flow. 



Sleep.  (Like a stage announcement. Flashing lights, music, etc.)

We all need it. 

But we're getting less and less of it. And that's bad. (music slows to a stop)

Sleep deprivation leads to something that Charles Czeisler, a sleep scientist, calls "attentional blinks." 

It's where your focus fades, initially for just a fraction of a second, like a blink. 
Over time, it grows, until you lose your ability to pay attention entirely. 

You slip into something called "local sleep." This is where only a part of the brain falls asleep, not the whole thing. This happens all the time. You'll look awake, you'll think you're fully alert and mentally competent, but you're not. 

This can be really dangerous.

Sleep deprivation in adults is pretty easy to identify. We start feeling drowsy, our focus gets fuzzy, we feel the need to rest.

Interestingly, kids tend to respond the opposite way. They become hyperactive. 

Either way, the impact is the same: We lost the ability to pay attention.



All of these different factors and components of attention have two sides: the individual side, and the societal side.

On the individual side, we have to do everything we can to take control of our attention and set ourselves up for success. 


Here are some of the things I do:

Do not disturb.

Timer for focus time. 

No phone on runs. (mind wandering)

Read every day.



On the other hand, we can't blame individuals for societal problems. 

Our environment is setup in a way that is chronically impacting our ability to pay attention. 

Chemicals like pesticides and plasticizers are so present in our everyday lives that it's impossible to escape them.

The most available food in most places is the worst option: fast food, convenience stores, etc. 

Technology companies use a business model that only succeeds when our attention fails. 

So individual solutions help, but they don't entirely fix the issue. In the case of social media,

"...a digital detox is 'not the solution, for the same reason that wearing a gas mask for two days a week outside isn't the answer to pollution.'" (James Williams in Stolen Focus)

All of these factors and more have been found to contribute to the destruction of our attention. 

And while individual actions matter, the default state of our society has to shift to one that's more in line with healthy habits. 

The best option should be the easiest one.




Nicoya, Costa Rica and Okinawa, Japan are some of the happiest and healthiest places on Earth. 

They both have a term that translates roughly to "a reason for being."
("Plan de vida" and "Ikigai" )

They have a deep sense of purpose in their life. 

This leads them to live more fulfilled, present lives. 

Living with purpose means living on purpose. It's choosing what we care about, and cutting out what doesn't matter. 

It's being intentional about avoiding the distractions in our lives and getting clear on what matters.

While we can't control everything, and some distractions are inevitable, having a sense of purpose helps us stay optimistic and allows us to focus on what matters most to us.







Wired. Adj. 
1. making use of computers to transfer or receive information, especially by means of the internet.
2. in a nervous, tense, or edgy state.

The dual definitions of this word are a bit uncanny, don't you think?

It's almost as if the definition itself is trying to suggest to us the exact that is putting us all on edge.

### Stolen Ideas



##### One: Increasing Speed, Switching, and Filtering
- "...a life full of distractions is, at an individual level, diminished. When you are unable to pay sustained attention, you can't achieve the things you want to achieve."
- "A study by professor Michael Posner at the University of Oregon found that if you are focusing on something and you get interrupted, on average it will take twenty-three minutes for you to get back to the same state of focus." [[switch cost effect]] - Every interruption lasts at least 23 minutes
- Definition of the word wired: 
	- 1. making use of computers to transfer or receive information, especially by means of the internet.
	- 2. in a nervous, tense, or edgy state.
- "Pre-commitment" is a way to beat destructive habits. It's the equivalent of Homer tying himself to the mast in the Odyssey. 
	- Make it harder to do the bad thing than it is to do the good thing. Tie yourself to the mast.
- We're sacrificing depth of attention for amount of information. We're increasing the density of our information load. More info, same brain. 
- Prof Earl Miller from MIT said "'Your brain can only produce one or two thoughts' in your conscious mind at once." "We have 'very limited cognitive capacity.'"
- The term [[multitasking]] was coined for computers, not people. 
	- Creates "creativity drain." New ideas come from the subconscious having time to process information. Multitasking doesn't allow that.
- Multitasking hurts our memory.
	- "it takes mental space and energy to convert your experiences into memories, and if you are spending your energy instead on switching very fast, you'll remember and learn less."
	- In a study at Carnegie Mellon University's Human Computer Interaction Lab, 136 students were tested for performance based on whether or not a phone was interrupting them. 
	- With phone interruptions, 20-30% worse performance.
	- [[monotasking]] is better. 
		- We can practice is in small bursts and build up the habit.
		- Tie yourself to the mast by removing the possibility of distraction

##### Two: Flow States
- [[flow state]]
- "This is when you are so absorbed by what you are doing that you lose all sense of yourself, and time seems to fall away, and you are flowing into the experience itself. It is the deepest form of focus and attention we know of."
	- Sounds a lot like presence to me.
- "Starved of flow, we become stumps of ourselves, sensing somewhere what we might have been."
- Everything you do makes you move towards fragmentation of attention or flow. It's always a choice. This is the continuum we live in regarding attention.

##### Three: Exhaustion
- 40% of Americans are chronically sleep-deprived.
- Parts of your brain can fall asleep on their own, called [[local sleep]]. One of the first parts of the brain to succumb to this is the part that recognizes that you're tired. This is why we get a 'second wind.' You just stop getting the tired signal. (story of falling while running as a teen)
	- "'part of the brain is awake, and part of the brain is asleep.'" - Charles Czeisler
	- "In this state, you believe you are alert and mentally competent - but you aren't."
- The effects of sleep deprivation: Adults become drowsy, children become hyperactive.
- When sleep deprived, the sympathetic nervous system jumps into high gear, because it thinks there's an emergency. 
	- Higher BP
	- Craving foods like sugar for quick energy
	- HR goes up
	- Your brain can't understand what's happening
	- Brain stops recognizing connections and patterns
	- The less you sleep, the worse your long term memory consolidation.

##### Four: Sustained Reading
- Reading books trains us to to focus on something specific for an extended period of time.
	- Internet reading, on the other hand, trains us to skim things and move quickly.
		- The medium is the message:
			- Facebook: life is to be displayed to others
			- IG: what matters is how you look on the outside
			- Twitter: the world should be simplified and condensed.
			- Book: life is complex, we need to slow down.
- Fiction books increase empathy - Raymond Mar, study at University of Toronto
	- Empathy makes progress possibly for humanity
- Viewing the world through news or social media only provides fragments, and "if you see the world through fragments, your empathy often doesn't kick in, in the way that it does when you engage with something in a sustained, focused way."

##### Five: Mind Wandering
- "Attention is usually defined as a person's ability to selectively attend to something in the environment."
	- Different types of focus
		- Spotlight. Focusing on something selective and specific.
- The more your mind gets to wander, the better you are at organizing personal goals. being creative, and making long-term decisions. 
- [[creativity is the processes of creating connections]]. Mind wandering gives our brain the room to do that.
	- We have to let our subconscious do some of the work.
- If we're always frantic and being exposed to new stimulus, our brains don't get the time to wander.
- In our current state, most of us don't spotlight focus or mind wander. We're just not focusing at all.
- Mind wandering is best experienced in low stress environments. If high stress or dangerous environment, this leads to anxiety.
- kSafe, Freedom app.

##### Six and Seven: Technology That Tracks You
- "He told me a digital detox is 'not the solution, for the same reason that wearing a gas mask for two days a week outside isn't the answer to pollution.'" (James Williams)
- We make different decisions when we are given a moment to pause and consider. We should build this into our habits with tech.
- The business model of tech companies is incentivized to hold onto our attention as long as possible. 
- The real purpose of tech is to make us better versions of ourselves, not change who we are.
- Surveillance capitalism is the term describing the tracking and advertising we see today. 
- Most social media train us to
	- Crave frequent rewards
	- Switch tasks often
	- Distract by understanding what excites, angers, etc. Learns triggers.

##### Eight: Cruel Optimism
- Cruel optimism "is when you take a really big problem with deep causes in our culture - like obesity, or depression, or addiction - and offer people, in upbeat language, a simplistic individual solution. It sounds optimistic, because you are telling them that the problem can be solved, and soon - but it is, in fact, cruel, because the solution you are offering is so limited, and so blind to the deeper causes, that for most people, it will fail." 
- "The people who say stress is just a matter of changing your thoughts are, he says, talking 'from a privileged position. It's easy for them to say that." (Talking to Ronald Purser.)
	- People that say that often have no real externally imposed stressors.
	- "It's the twenty-first-century version of Marie Antoinette saying, 'Let them eat cake.' Let them be present."
	- I have slight problem with that, because then there are people like Thich Nhat Hanh
- Cruel optimist denies the reality of most people's lives. Not everyone knows how to set things up in a way that are better for them, and more importantly, they shouldn't have to. Our purchases should come default in a way that doesn't significantly ruin our attention.
- We need a change to the default lifestyle of our culture.
- Most of the individual tweaks we can make are the equivalent of "digital diet books. But diet books didn't solve the obesity crisis and digital die books won't solve the attention crisis."
- The individual solutions are helpful and important, but focusing only on those denies the greater problem that exists.

##### Nine: First Glimpses of the Deeper Solution
- When lead paint was found to cause brain damage, we eventually banned the lead in paint. We didn't get rid of paint. We just got rid of the bad part.
- Same with hairspray and CFCs harming the ozone. Now the ozone is healing.
- Banning surveillance capitalism.
	- Possible business models 
		- Subscription rather than ads.
		- Government / public ownership, like BBC (Would have to be run independent of the gov)
	- Personally, I like the way YouTube has the option of subscription for no ads. I think that might be the best direction

##### Ten: Surge in Stress
- Financial security makes people smarter (a study on Universal Basic Income)

##### Eleven: Reversing the Surge in Speed and Exhaustion
- Four day work wee at Perpetual Guardian resulted in 30-40% higher engagement, teamwork, as well as a 15% drop in self reported stress levels.
- Work hours went up during COVID, which is unfortunate because this could've been a great time to test.
- The French have the "right to disconnect."
	- Must have clearly defined work hours. When those are over, you have to right to completely unplug. There is a formal negotiation of hours they can be contacted. Clearly defined boundaries.

##### Twelve: Diets and Pollution
- Healthy eating is too hard. It takes a lot of effort to do what should be the default. This is a structural problem.
- With pollutants, it is often the case that it is innocent until proven guilty. It should be the opposite.
- Main pollutant culprits are pesticides, plasticizers, flame-retardants, and cosmetics, according to Prof Barbara Demeneix.
- Trying to escape pollutants is basically useless because our environment is so full of them. To make any real progress, we have to change our environment.

##### Thirteen: ADHD
- ADHD has skyrocketed throughout the past few decades.
- Science can't really agree on much regarding ADHD, probably because it's mostly a comparatively new area of study. 
- One thing is for sure: People diagnosed ADHD are experiencing a real issue. They're not faking it or making it up. It's just we don't know exactly what's causing it, or how to fix it.
	- And if you do experience these issues, it's not your fault.
- Nicholas Dodman, vet. Horses suffering from an issue due to domestication. They suffer from "frustrated biological objectives." So are we. 
	- These animals are drugged to ease the pain caused by their dysfunctional environment rather than managing the environmental conditions.
- Children are fed a "diet lacking nutrients", and are put in an environment "preparing them for high-stress testing, with very little space for nurturing their curiosity." No wonder we're seeing issues. They have a dysfunctional environment.
- Drugs should be prescribed only as a worst case scenario, and they should be temporary as the greater issue is dealt with.
	- ADHD drugs cause lack of sleep, perpetuating the problem.
- "genes aren't destiny; rather they affect probability" - Alan Sroufe

##### Fourteen: Confinement of Children
- Childhood autonomy has been diminished, resulting in lack of exploration.
	- City design matters here
- Play teaches meta-skills, like negotiation and coping with disappointment.
