I've helped create over a dozen communities in the past 5 years I have it broken down to a repeatable process

Today I will teach you the entire process so you can offer it as an agency service And get paid $5000+ a month per client

**1. Why are communities in demand**

Owning an audience is vital for 2022. Relying on one social media platform for sales is dangerous,

You can get banned and boom your source of revenue is gone

Owning a community is like having an email list on steroids

And learning how to build a community for your brand now is your biggest safety net These people will buy from you multiple times over They are your brand raving fan base



**2. Your agency structure**

Agencies are broken down into these main categories

a. Business Foundations

b. Prospecting & Close

c. Onboarding

d. Getting client results

e. Reporting, retention, optimization

Let’s break each down




**3. Business foundations**

This is about your offer, positioning

Your positioning: This is how you want your agency to be visualized inside the minds of your prospect


Targeting: Ecom Brands, SaaS, Personal Brands Main offer: Every detail of community creation & management. Community structure, community branding, community content strategy, community launch strategy, community launch, community management, community optimization




**4. Prospecting & Close**

Prospecting for this (As of right now) is pretty straightforward because the demand is there but not many people are offering this service


C/ Prospecting 2 routes I would start with (assuming I don't have this account) 1. Begin twitter again - Open a Twitter account, create a list of the top accounts I want to engage with, post witty comments under their tweets Find accounts in my follower range,

- Define offer & positioning Offer: Email marketing for SaaS based on performance Positioning: You are bleeding extra revenue with your brand. Email marketing is extra revenue with 0 extra ad spend. We are the only SaaS email agency - Create all assets: Website to book calls




**5. Onboarding**

Onboarding is about getting all the assets and accesses you need from the client

You will need access to their branding guidelines to stay on brand as well as access to any current community platform they have

Here’s how to obtain them

Send an email immediately when someone pays you

The email will showcase the low hanging fruits, what you need from them, and invite them to your communication software like slack

From here you ask to book a 15 min call with them to talk next steps for the month




**6. Getting client results.**

This is the most important part of this thread. Remember the offer above?

All those mini-sub offers inside of it are the systems we have to create,

Let’s go over each of them

**Community structure:**

- A library: use mightynetworks. This will be the hub of all the main value your community offers

- A chat: use discord. This will be the hub to chat with likeminded members

**Community branding**

- Congruent themes for every touchpoint of the community

**Community content strategy**

- Content calendar for the content you will provide in the community

- Partner deals with other brands in your niche. Exchange promotional slots for value

- Goal is to have 2-3 value pieces being posted a day in the community

**Community launch strategy**

- 3 days of pre hype to your audience by poking them with pains

- 7 Days of real hype to your audience and collect emails for the early launch offer

- Go live with a unique launch offer for 3 days then increase the price on day 4 of go live

**Community management**

- Discord rituals & engagement calendar

- Weekly live calls with all members

- Bi-weekly live calls with experts in the industry

- Setup gamification with discord to reward top engagers

**Community optimization**

The goal here is to understand that communities need to be alive Members engage and become lifelong friends

Every community is different so you must keep your ears to the ground and see what new additions/rituals you can add to your community




**7. Reporting, Retention, Referrals**
