Pre-commitment is a practice where you commit to something before the urge to do the opposite. It's helpful in beating destructive habits.

For example, if you have an issue with eating chips all the time, don't buy any chips. There won't be any to eat when the cravings hit.

In the Odyssey, Homer has his crew tie him to the mast when they pass the sirens. "Tie yourself to the mast" is a great analogy for this.
