This is a quote from Tom Sachs.


The reward for good work is more work. 

It's this idea of loving the process more than the outcome. 

It's not that you have to do it, it's that you get to. And when you're done, you get to do more, differently.

When you get fixed on the outcome, you start to become more worried about what people think of your work. You compare yourself rather than drawing inspiration from others. You'll never be as good as them, you think. 

The reward for your work is not the admiration of those who enjoy it. Sure, if you do good work for long enough, you might have the opportunity to reach some people and build some sort of community around it. But that's not the reward. That's bonus. The reward for good work is more work. 

This is an idea that applies specifically to creative work.
