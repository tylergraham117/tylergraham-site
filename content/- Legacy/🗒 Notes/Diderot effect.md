The Diderot effect, named after the French writer and philosopher Denis Diderot, describes our tendency to over consume. Often, this need for overconsumption is a form of [[aspirational consumerism]], and derives from our desire to improve our lives.

This effect often comes into place to fill space or to unify the quality of our living space.

To avoid this effect, it's helpful to be conscious of the [[hedonic treadmill]]. This makes us aware that buying that new thing will not make us happier in any long term timeline. Unfortunately, this is not enough. It relies entirely on us being able to make the right decision all the time, which is completely unrealistic. To further combat this effect, we can implement some simple [[rules of consumption]] for ourselves. An example of this is to refuse to buy anything the same day you find out about it. Instead, wait a day, a week, even a month. You've gone your whole life without it, so waiting won't kill you. If you still want it after this time period, then it's probably something worth buying. Another rule you could implement is a budget.
