# acknowledging presence forces its conclusion



Presence is, by definition, all consuming. Once you so much as recognize its occurrence, the state of being is stopped by internal dialogue and rampant thought. 

If you're working, for example, and achieve a [[flow state]], you tend not to notice it until afterwards. If you do notice it, it pulls you out of it. Becoming aware of a state presence is just another distraction, and you will suffer the consequences of the [[switch cost effect]].
