Anything, no matter how exciting it initially is, can become a boring, monotonous routine over time. This may be because [[we don't notice our objective status]].

People have a marvelous ability to adapt. We've used this ability, less than consciously, to survive as long as we have as a species. As a result, we've likely become accustom to constant change. It seems as if [[there is a rhythm to change]] as well, largely based on the cyclical nature of the natural world.

In the modern era, however, this natural rhythm is interrupted. We're not exposed to the elements, we don't feel the inherent change in the seasons. The constant marching of time is not felt as deeply, and everything bleeds together.

With this comes an issue. Things become monotonous. Through routine, people become overly used to their surroundings and their situation. We all look for little boosts of happiness, often externally, but the [[hedonic treadmill]] brings us right back down to baseline after a while. 

The solution to this is novelty. Experiencing [[novelty slows down time]] and helps us create [[peak experiences]]. Basically, [[the mundane can be exciting if we approach it right]]. When we find ourselves becoming bored with something we do often, it's beneficial to introduce something different. Making a habit of embracing change in this way not only keeps things exciting, but increases our [[tolerance for ambiguity]].
