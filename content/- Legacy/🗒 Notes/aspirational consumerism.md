Aspirational consumerism describes the phenomenon of people buying things they thing will help solve a problem. It's the answer to the question, "why do we buy things we don't need and don't use?"

Often times, people buy things based on an [[aspirational identity]]. The hope when purchasing is generally tied to a desire to create a new habit or behavior that we think is a positive. We use consumerism to satiate a need that we have.
When the purchase fails to do this for us immediately, we quit using it, sometime blaming the purchase.

One explanation of why people make purchasing decisions in this aspirational way is a concept known as [[identity based decision making]]. Another explanation could be the [[Diderot effect]]. Another possible explanation is that we weight the cost of the item against the potential gain. If the expected benefits outweigh the costs, we buy. The problem is that marketers make is seem like the benefits are going to outweigh the cost, and it's not always necessarily accurate.

While we don't necessarily have clear scientific consensus on why aspirational consumerism exists, it's pretty clear that buying things unnecessarily is not beneficial to our life. We have to move from aspirational to [[conscious consumerism]].
