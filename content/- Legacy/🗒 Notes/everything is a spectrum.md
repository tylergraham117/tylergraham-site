The world is a remarkably complicated set of systems, most of which we only have a very small window of understanding of how they work. 

In most situations, the brain wants to conserve energy, so [[we default to the path of least resistance]], like water running off a mountain. Because of this, we often unconsciously simplify complex systems into binaries. The big issue with this is that [[diluting something far enough makes it a different thing]]. By oversimplifying complex spectrums into binaries, we start to see everything in that way. 

It goes from trying to understand people, situations, and the world around us in a broad way to thinking we can apply a label and easily understand what's going on. This is a big theme in the book "Why Fish Don't Exist." We [[people want to label the world]] because organization is comforting and easier to understand quickly. Unfortunately, it's also usually wrong.
