It's important to be aware of what you are consuming because [[we are a function of our environment]]. This is especially true in the case of media consumption. It's the classic "garbage in, garbage out scenario." If we consistently consume bad media, by whatever metric you define bad, then you will pollute your mind with it. 

In the case of what we buy, it is important to practice  [[conscious consumerism]] to avoid buying things we don't need. Many people are plagued by [[aspirational consumerism]] and the [[Diderot effect]]. 

Basically, in all aspects of like, it's important to be aware of what we let into our lives, making sure it's a conscious decision and not an unconscious one based on the will of others.
