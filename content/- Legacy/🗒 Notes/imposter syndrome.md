Imposter syndrome is a term to describe the feeling of doubting ones ability to do something, even if they are fully qualified. It's a form of self doubt and has a tendency to make you feel like a fraud. 

Often, if we have the opportunity to do something, it is because we are fully qualified. This means that we shouldn't let impostor syndrome get in the way of us doing new things or taking advantage of opportunities. 

Imposter syndrome is probably most prevalent in creative pursuits. To combat this, it's helpful to remember that [[nothing is original]].  



Impostor syndrome seems to be most prevalent in high achievers. It is possible that their tendency to doubt themselves fuels their level of achievement and the quality they are able to produce. In this way, [[self consciousness can be helpful]]. It means they are hyper aware of their abilities. 

Some people make better decisions when feeling like impostors. Confidence is lower, leading them to work harder and more intentionally. We may be better off slightly underestimating ourselves.
