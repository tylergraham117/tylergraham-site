# living a noteworthy life means living in a way worth taking notes on


The word noteworthy simply means "interesting, significant, or unusual." 

Interesting, significant, and unusual things happen in our lives all of the time, and I think most of us just let those moments go by unrecognized. In my opinion, that is a massive mistake. I think a [[forgotten life is equivalent to one that never happened]], which is why you have to try to [[remember your life]].

If we want to be more fulfilled in our lives, we have to [[pay attention to the world]] around us. This is hard because [[our world is full of distractions]]. We can combat this simply by engaging with life more deeply and writing down the noteworthy things that occur. 

I use a variety of different methods of writing down notes, and I'm always adjusting and building on my system. Really, the method doesn't matter as long as you have one. It's easy to adjust things as we go, as in any good system. Borrowing from computer science, [[galls law]] explains that we should start really simply and expand as necessary, but no sooner.
