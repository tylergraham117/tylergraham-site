# living our values



The importance of living within your values is obvious. At the end of the day, [[you are what you do]]. If you're not doing what you believe in, then you don't believe it deeply enough. At the end of the day, [[people do what they desire most]], even if they don't fully understand it at the time. Our [[priorities are where we spend the most time]], not what we say our priorities are.

Our values are often more theory than practice. They tend to be aspirational. People are flawed, so we hold an [[aspirational identity]] as a vision for who we'd like to be. The problem is, we don't always have specific actions to get us there. We sort of hope it'll just happen. 

Instead, we should create specific habits that help us become the type of person we want to be. To do that, we have to have [[clearly defined values]]. It's not enough to just think them. 

After we have our values written out in clear terms, we can think about some actions that really embody each specific value. Then, we commit to building a habit out of these actions. By performing these, we take advantage of *cognitive dissonance*, and over time we will become the person we want to be.
