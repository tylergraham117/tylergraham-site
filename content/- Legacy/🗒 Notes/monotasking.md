Monotasking is the practice of doing one thing at a time with a deep sense of purpose and intention. 

Monotasking invites us to experience flow. This version of [[flow state]].

I've noticed that when I work in this way, I get much more done and enjoy doing it much more.

Many Zen practitioners teach this.
