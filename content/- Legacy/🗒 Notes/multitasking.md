Multitasking is a commonly used phrase that refers to quickly bouncing between multiple tasks. 

In [[hustle culture]], this often praised and seen as a good thing.

In reality, there are significant costs to multitasking. One of the most prominent is the [[switch cost effect]]. Another is a reduction in creativity. Since [[creativity is the processes of creating connections]], we must give the brain time to do that. If we're constantly overloading out minds with switching between tasks, the brain has less time to create these associations. 

There is some clear research behind multitasking. Apparently [[the brain has very limited cognitive capacity]]. 

In fact, the term multitasking was originally not even coined for people, but for computers. It came about in the 1960's when computer scientists invented new computers that contained multiple processors and were therefore capable of actually doing more that one thing at a time. 

The opposite, and better alternative to multitasking is [[monotasking]].
