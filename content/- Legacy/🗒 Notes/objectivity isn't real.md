Everything is a matter of perspective, and [[everyone has a different perspective on the world]]. As people, [[we are beings of conscious awareness]]. That is our superpower. It also means that, within that consciousness, there can be no such thing as objectivity. We can get close, but never fully experience things as they truly are, because our way of experience happens within consciousness, something that does not exist outside of us.
