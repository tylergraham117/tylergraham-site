The paradox of personality is an observation that people's best qualities tend to also be the worst. It's a [[Double-Edged Sword]]. 

Some examples:
- Decisiveness can also be commanding and less open to learning.
- Fun and adventure can also be easily distracted and unfocused.

In dealing with this, it's important and useful to play into strengths while remaining aware of the shadow side of that strength. As in anything, [[balance is the key]]. It also seems true that, while people do have more or less of certain qualities, it's not a binary on or off. As the world continues to reveal, [[everything is a spectrum]] and it's important to be aware of that in order to avoid oversimplifying our complex world. People often want a binary because it's easy, but [[diluting something far enough makes it a different thing]].
