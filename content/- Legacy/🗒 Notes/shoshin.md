# shoshin


Shoshin is a word from Zen Buddhism meaning [[beginner's mind]]. It refers to having an attitude of openness, eagerness, and lack of preconceptions when studying a subject, even when studying it at an advanced level, just as a beginner would.

A large amount of curiosity and a good bit of tenacity or diligence creates wonders of intelligence. I think this is a recipe for a large range of expertise, and a marvelous breeding ground for creativity to take place. 

Since [[creativity is the processes of creating connections]], we have to be open to seeing new things in an area we think we already know quite a bit about, or else our thoughts on the subject will begin to get stale.
