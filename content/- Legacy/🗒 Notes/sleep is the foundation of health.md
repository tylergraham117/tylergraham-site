# Sleep is the foundation of health
*Healthy sleep is the prerequisite for a healthy life.*

Matthew Walker, the sleep guy, explained on RRP that he used to see sleep as a major pillar of health. Now, he sees it as the foundation on which those other pillars sit.

##### Amount
Amount of sleep should be between 7.5 - 9 hours. This varies from person to person. I find that the wake up time being on an interval of 1.5 hours is useful, as it makes sure waking up lands between sleep cycles. 

You can control when you go to sleep.


##### Light
Sleep should happen in darkness.

Circadian rhythm is driven primarily by light. We should avoid light before our temperature minimum and get light after. 


##### Caffeine
Avoid caffeine after the morning. The half life is long. The brain needs time to experience adenosine (sleep pressure).
