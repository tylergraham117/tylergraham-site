A Tokonoma is most commonly a recessed wall in which one displays some sort of art. The art is generally changed periodically. 

The idea here is that by singling out a single work, it is appreciated fully, but changed out in order to avoid getting used to that work, therefore keeping the appreciation alive.

The Tokonoma design style was the inspiration for the modern American fireplace, adapted by Frank Lloyd Wright.

Within the space the Tokonoma occupied, other household object are not permitted. In addition, no person is allowed to step into this (basically sacred) space except to change the artwork in the Tokonoma. Thus, [[we are helped by what is to use what is not]]. The lack of clutter and really anything else allows everyone to focus on the important piece: the art. It is appreciated more fully this way. This is a similar idea to [[Meditation]], where the silence allows for intense concentration to take place. Also related, [[rests are part of the music]].
