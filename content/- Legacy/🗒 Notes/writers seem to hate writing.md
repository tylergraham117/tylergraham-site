Most writers seem to have a strange relationship with writing. 

They can't not write. It's this intrinsic drive they all seem to have in common that compels them to get whatever stories are in them out. 

Neil Gaiman combats this with a simple rule. He sits down in the chair to write, opens his notebook, and says to himself, "[[you can either write, or not write, but nothing else]]." This seems to work for him. Most [[people are afraid of boredom]], so writing ends up being easier than doing nothing.
