Neil Gaiman has a practice where he sits down to write each working day, and gives himself the option to either write or not write, but nothing else. 

Most of the time he ends up writing. 

Most [[writers seem to hate writing]], but it's not necessarily that they don't want to write. It's really that they don't want to go through what it takes to get into "writing mode," or [[flow state]], which would allows one to become lost in whatever they are working on. It envelops them and pulls them into a really intense state of presence. 

There are two crucial points to this practice:
1. It cuts down your choices, avoiding the [[paradox of choice]]. It's either write or don't. Don't waste energy thinking about other options.
2. It limits distractions and encourages [[monotasking]], which helps avoid the [[switch cost effect]], a phenomenon describing the impact on the brain of swapping between one task and another, commonly referred to as [[multitasking]]. 

Getting yourself to sit down and write, especially when you don't want to, is probably the biggest differentiator between hobbyists and professionals. Over a long timeline, making [[consistent progress is what gets things done]], not short bursts of work.
