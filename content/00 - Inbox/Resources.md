# Resources

Everything I do, say, and even think burns energy.

The First Law of Thermodynamics clearly states that energy cannot be created nor destroyed. 

So where does our energy to do, say, and think come from?

In a physical sense, originally, food. When we eat food, we burn calories to give our bodies the mechanical energy necessary to do, say, and think things. That caloric energy comes from plants and animals. Animals get it from plants, so really it all comes from plants. Plants get energy from the sun via photosynthesis. The sun gets energy from burning gaseous elements floating about in the vast emptiness of space (or something idk I'm not a scientist.)

Point is, not very far down the line, our energy to do, say, and think came from space. And in anything we do, say, and think, we are using a finite, recycled resource that could have been used for something else. How do we justify taking energy from something else to do, say, or think what we are? What gives us the right to that energy in the first place?

Maybe its when we try and use the resources at our disposal for the good of something greater than ourselves. Maybe its helping others or preserving natural life in some way. 

It most certainly is not complaining. Nor is it needlessly fighting. Nor is it taking advantage of others or buying things we don't need, which took resources to make, nor is it wasting away out lives with meaningless activity or unfulfilling action, or lack thereof.

Thus, I have come to realize, it is our moral obligation to use the gifts of life and the resources literally bestowed upon us from the stars to live a life that we are able to derive meaning from. To do otherwise is to take that ability from someone else, or to take energy from some other life system in need. That's inherantlyently selfish. 

> I think when this turns into a script or writing piece it needs to end before the pessimism begins. Hopeful, not negative or judgemental.
