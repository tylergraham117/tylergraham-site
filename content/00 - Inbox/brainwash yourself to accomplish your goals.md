# brainwash yourself to accomplish your goals


Conscious consumption. You become what you consume. 

If you want to be X, consume Y.

I'll just give a list of X's and a the Y's that go along with it.

How to create change quickly.


If you want to change but are struggling to, find a bunch of people that posses the quality you want, and make content about it (it won't be hard to find) and then consume it like crazy.

If you want to eat better for your health, find people that talk about this.

This taps into our ancient brain circuits that make us feel if we mess up, we'll get kicked out of the tribe and eaten by a bear.

You can just brainwash yourself into establishing a new normal of whatever behavior you want. "You become the bla bla 5 people you spend your time with"
