# Why Is It So Hard for Men to Make Close Friends?


- One simple way to practice being emotionally unguarded is to “tell your friends how you feel about them,” Mr. Fager said. “It’s just so important for your friends to know that you value the relationship — that you admire the person or you respect the person or you love the person.” 
- Another strategy is to join a structured peer-support group 
- Don’t assume friendship happens organically 
- “Making friends as an adult requires initiative,” 
- Dr. Franco recommends finding ways to turn daily activities into opportunities for connection, too. If you are a runner, invite a friend to go for a run with you. If you work from home, she said, ask a colleague to come over and “co-work.”
  Just be mindful that activities can limit intimacy. Consider switching things up every once in a while. 
- casually reaching out to friends and acquaintances — through, say, a quick text or email — means more to those people than we tend to realize, and is particularly powerful when the contact is unexpected.
