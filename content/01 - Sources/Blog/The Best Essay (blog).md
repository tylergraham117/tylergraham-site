# The Best Essay (blog)

>"The best essay would be on the most important topic you could tell people something surprising about."

Surprise is part of the equation. You have to tell people something they don't already know, or at least present it in a new way.


>"I imagined when I started writing this that the best essay would be fairly timeless — that the best essay you could write in 1844 would be much the same as the best one you could write now. But in fact the opposite seems to be true. It might be true that the best painting would be timeless in this sense. But it wouldn't be impressive to write an essay introducing natural selection now. The best essay _now_ would be one describing a great discovery we didn't yet know about."

It's not impressive to present incredible writing on something everyone already knows. The discovery is part of it.


>" There is, and on the face of it, it seems almost identical to the one I started with. Instead of asking _what would the best essay be?_ I should have asked _how do you write essays well?_ Though these seem only phrasing apart, their answers diverge. The answer to the first question, as we've seen, isn't really about essay writing. The second question forces it to be."

By shifting the question and not being so concerned with the *best* essay, we can actually focus on writing a good one.


> "Writing essays, at its best, is a way of discovering ideas. How do you do that well? How do you discover by writing?"

[[writing is thinking]]



To write a good essay, you need to ask a good question (or have a good idea.) Simply asking a question about something most people take for granted can be enough edge to make it a good question.
Inquire into the areas people take for granted.



> "Once you've got a question, then what? You start thinking out loud about it. Not literally out loud, but you commit to a specific string of words in response, as you would if you were talking. This initial response is usually mistaken or incomplete. Writing converts your ideas from vague to bad. But that's a step forward, because once you can see the brokenness, you can fix it.  
  Perhaps beginning writers are alarmed at the thought of starting with something mistaken or incomplete, but you shouldn't be, because this is why essay writing works. Forcing yourself to commit to some specific string of words gives you a starting point, and if it's wrong, you'll see that when you reread it. At least half of essay writing is rereading what you've written and asking _is this correct and complete?_ You have to be very strict when rereading, not just because you want to keep yourself honest, but because a gap between your response and the truth is often a sign of new ideas to be discovered."

Much of essay writing is committing to an idea, discovering that it's wrong or incomplete, and iterating on it. 



> "Usually there are several possible responses to a question, which means you're traversing a tree. But essays are linear, not tree-shaped, which means you have to choose one branch to follow at each point. How do you choose? Usually you should follow whichever offers the greatest combination of generality and novelty. I don't consciously rank branches this way; I just follow whichever seems most exciting; but generality and novelty are what make a branch exciting."

You have to cut the branches of your question/idea tree until only the most general and novel (exciting) one is left. 
[[storytelling is about withholding information]]



> "In general you want to be quick to cut. One of the most dangerous temptations in writing (and in software and painting) is to keep something that isn't right, just because it contains a few good bits or cost you a lot of effort."

Be quick to cut things that aren't just right.
[[sunk cost fallacy]]



> "Can we predict which questions will yield great essays? Considering how long I've been writing essays, it's alarming how novel that question feels.  
  One thing I like in an initial question is outrageousness. I love questions that seem naughty in some way — for example, by seeming counterintuitive or overambitious or heterodox. Ideally all three."

The premise of the essay should be a bit outside the box. If it's too mundane, who cares?



> "While breadth comes from reading and talking and seeing, depth comes from doing. The way to really learn about some domain is to have to solve problems in it. Though this could take the form of writing, I suspect that to be a good essayist you also have to do, or have done, some other kind of work. That may not be true for most other fields, but essay writing is different. You could spend half your time working on something else and be net ahead, so long as it was hard."

We get a wide range of ideas and knowledge from inputs, but we get depth from outputs. Coming up with creative solutions to problems is the only way to learn about something deeply.


> "At some point the cycle of question and response reaches what feels like a natural end. Which is a little suspicious; shouldn't every answer suggest more questions? I think what happens is that you start to feel sated. Once you've covered enough interesting ground, you start to lose your appetite for new questions. Which is just as well, because the reader is probably feeling sated too. And it's not lazy to stop asking questions, because you could instead be asking the initial question of a new essay.  
  That's the ultimate source of drag on the connectedness of ideas: the discoveries you make along the way. If you discover enough starting from question A, you'll never make it to question B. Though if you keep writing essays you'll gradually fix this problem by burning off such discoveries. So bizarrely enough, writing lots of essays makes it as if the space of ideas were more highly connected."

Discovering new ideas is the ultimate source of drag on the connectedness of ideas. As we discover more, we start to feel satisfied, and end up stopping our search. This is not a bad thing. We'll come around to it again at some point if we keep being curious.


> "to be the evergreen kind of timeless, an essay has to be ineffective, in the sense that its discoveries aren't assimilated into our shared culture. Otherwise there will be nothing new in it for the second generation of readers. If you want to surprise readers not just now but in the future as well, you have to write essays that won't stick — essays that, no matter how good they are, won't become part of what people in the future learn before they read them. 
> 
> I can imagine several ways to do that. One would be to write about things people never learn. For example, it's a long-established pattern for ambitious people to chase after various types of prizes, and only later, perhaps too late, to realize that some of them weren't worth as much as they thought. If you write about that, you can be confident of a conveyor belt of future readers to be surprised by it.
> 
> Ditto if you write about the tendency of the inexperienced to overdo things — of young engineers to produce overcomplicated solutions, for example. There are some kinds of mistakes people never learn to avoid except by making them. Any of those should be a timeless topic."

For an essay to be timeless, it has to be ineffective in the sense that is isn't adopted into the normal lexicon of culture. 
A book example of this is Gladwell's work in [[Outliers (book)]].

The things he writes as examples of things people never learn (ambitious people chase things to realize that's not a source of happiness; tendency of the inexperienced to overdo things) are things that people *hear about,*  but don't learn. 
You can write about those types of things to be evergreen, because it is such a part of the human condition that even when we learn it, we don't internalize it.
There is a [[difference between learning and internalizing]].


> "Another recipe for timelessness is to write about things readers already know, but in much more detail than can be transmitted culturally. "Everyone knows," for example, that it can be rewarding to have [kids](https://www.paulgraham.com/kids.html). But till you have them you don't know precisely what forms that takes, and even then much of what you know you may never have put into words."

Another way for an essay to be timeless is to write more deeply about something that everyone sort of know something about.


> "Writing about topics of timeless importance is an instance of something even more general, though: breadth of applicability. And there are more kinds of breadth than chronological — applying to lots of different fields, for example. So breadth is the ultimate aim.  
  
> I already aim for it. Breadth and novelty are the two things I'm always chasing. But I'm glad I understand where timelessness fits.  
  
> I understand better where a lot of things fit now. This essay has been a kind of tour of essay writing. I started out hoping to get advice about topics; if you assume good writing, the only thing left to differentiate the best essay is its topic. And I did get advice about topics: discover natural selection. Yeah, that would be nice. But when you step back and ask what's the best you can do short of making some great discovery like that, the answer turns out to be about procedure. Ultimately the quality of an essay is a function of the ideas discovered in it, and the way you get them is by casting a wide net for questions and then being very exacting with the answers."

Breadth and novelty are the aim, but timelessness has a place.
**The way to write a good essay is to have a good procedure. The quality of an essay is a function of the ideas discovered within it. The way you discover ideas is by casting a wide net of questions and being very exacting and particular with the answers.**


> But although I wish I could say that writing great essays depends mostly on effort, in the limit case it's inspiration that makes the difference. In the limit case, the questions are the harder thing to get. That pool has no bottom.  

Effort isn't really the thing that makes or breaks it. It's the inspiration and the questions.
**The line of questioning, and the willingness to seek out a precise answer, is how you write a good essay.**

  
>How to get more questions? That is the most important question of all.

I suppose be curious, but that's not something we can force. It's only something we can allow to grow over time.
