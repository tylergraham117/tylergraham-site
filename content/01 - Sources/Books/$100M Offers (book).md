## Highlights
- you can improve your skills to shift the odds in your favor. Simply stated, with enough skill, you can become the house. ([Location 100](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B099QVG1H8&location=100))
- “Make people an offer so good they would feel stupid saying no.” ([Location 264](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B099QVG1H8&location=264))
- once the discomfort of staying the same surpasses the discomfort of change, they take the leap. ([Location 270](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B099QVG1H8&location=270))
- it is far better to have understood why you failed than to be ignorant of why you succeeded. ([Location 296](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B099QVG1H8&location=296))
- business owners just barely “get by.” They essentially “buy themselves a job” and work 100 hours a week to avoid working 40. Crappy trade. ([Location 312](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B099QVG1H8&location=312))
- I’ve made my money doing this stuff, not teaching how to do this stuff, contrary to most of the marketing community at large. ([Location 334](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B099QVG1H8&location=334))
- Einstein says, “never memorize anything you can look up.” ([Location 361](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B099QVG1H8&location=361))
- Grow or Die” is a core tenet at our companies. We believe every person, every company, and every organism is either growing or dying. Maintenance is a myth. ([Location 376](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B099QVG1H8&location=376))
- The market is continuously growing. The stock market grows at 9 percent per year. If we aren't growing at 9 percent per year, we are falling behind. “Maintenance,” in the most generic sense, would be 9 percent growth year over year. ([Location 379](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B099QVG1H8&location=379))
- what does it take to grow? Thankfully, just three simple things: Get more customers Increase their average purchase value Get them to buy more times ([Location 383](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B099QVG1H8&location=383))
- There are really only two ways to grow: get more customers, and increase each customer’s value. ([Location 392](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B099QVG1H8&location=392))
- “Increasing each customer’s value” has two sub-buckets: 1) Increasing profit per purchase 2) Increasing the number of times they buy. ([Location 393](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B099QVG1H8&location=393))
- a Grand Slam Offer helps with all three of the requirements for growth: getting more customers, getting them to pay more, and getting them to do so more times. ([Location 415](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B099QVG1H8&location=415))
- sell your product based on VALUE not on PRICE. ([Location 417](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B099QVG1H8&location=417))
- A commodity, as I define it, is a product available from many places. For that reason, it’s prone to purchases based on “price” instead of “value.” If all products are “equal,” then the cheapest one is the most valuable by default. ([Location 420](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B099QVG1H8&location=420))
- if a prospect compares your product to another and thinks “these are pretty much the same, I’ll buy the cheaper one,” then they commoditized you. ([Location 422](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B099QVG1H8&location=422))
- It’s an offer you present to the marketplace that cannot be compared to any other product or service available, combining an attractive promotion, an unmatchable value proposition, a premium price, and an unbeatable guarantee with a money model (payment terms) that allows you to get paid to get new customers . . . forever removing the cash constraint on business growth. ([Location 429](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B099QVG1H8&location=429))
- sell in a “category of one,” or, to apply another great phrase, to “sell in a vacuum.” ([Location 432](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B099QVG1H8&location=432))
- The resulting purchasing decision for the prospect is now between your product and nothing. ([Location 433](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B099QVG1H8&location=433))
- you can sell at whatever price you get the prospect to perceive, not in comparison to anything else. ([Location 434](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B099QVG1H8&location=434))
    - Note: Theres no amount the thing should cost. Entirely Up to how you make them perceive the value.
- Your Grand Slam Offer, however, forces a prospect to stop and think differently to assess the value of your differentiated product. Doing this establishes you as your own category, which means it’s too difficult to compare prices, which means you re-calibrate the prospect’s value-meter. ([Location 446](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B099QVG1H8&location=446))
- We want to make an offer that’s so different that you can skip the awkward explanation of why your product is different from everyone elses (which, if they have to ask, then they are probably too ignorant to understand the explanation) and instead just have the offer do that work for you. ([Location 471](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B099QVG1H8&location=471))
- If you play the same game everyone else does, you’ll get the same results everyone else does (mediocre). ([Location 493](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B099QVG1H8&location=493))
- At the end of the day, if there is a ton of demand for a solution, you can be mediocre at business, have a terrible offer, and have no ability to persuade people, and you can still make money. ([Location 517](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B099QVG1H8&location=517))
- There is a market in desperate need of your abilities. You need to find it. And when you do, you will capitalize, all while wondering what took you so long. ([Location 540](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B099QVG1H8&location=540))
- remember that picking a market, like anything, is always our choice, so choose wisely. ([Location 541](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B099QVG1H8&location=541))
- In order to sell anything, you need demand. We are not trying to create demand. We are trying to channel it. That is a very important distinction. ([Location 542](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B099QVG1H8&location=542))
    - Note: Why try to create demand when you could just find some?
- as a market that is growing at the same rate as the marketplace and that has common unmet needs that fall into one of three categories: improved health, increased wealth, or improved relationships. ([Location 544](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B099QVG1H8&location=544))
- They must not want, but desperately need, what I am offering. Pain can be anything that frustrates people about their lives. Being broke is painful. A bad marriage is painful. Waiting in line at the grocery stores is painful. Back pain . . . ugly smile pain . . . overweight pain . . . Humans suffer a lot. So for us entrepreneurs, endless opportunity abounds. ([Location 552](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B099QVG1H8&location=552))
- The degree of the pain will be proportional to the price you will be able to charge ([Location 555](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B099QVG1H8&location=555))
- When they hear the solution to their pain, and inversely, what their life would look like without this pain, they should be drawn to your solution. ([Location 556](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B099QVG1H8&location=556))
- “The pain is the pitch.” If you can articulate the pain a prospect is feeling accurately, they will almost always buy what you are offering. A prospect must have a painful problem for us to solve and charge money for our solution. ([Location 557](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B099QVG1H8&location=557))
- The point of good writing is for the reader to understand. The point of good persuasion is for the prospect to feel understood. ([Location 560](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B099QVG1H8&location=560))
- your audience needs to be able to afford the service you’re charging them for. Make sure your targets have the money, or access to the amount of money, needed to buy your services at the prices you require to make it worth your time. ([Location 566](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B099QVG1H8&location=566))
- you want to make sure you can target your ideal audience easily. ([Location 574](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B099QVG1H8&location=574))
- Health, Wealth, and Relationships. The reason that those will always exist is that there is always tremendous pain when you lack them. ([Location 581](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B099QVG1H8&location=581))
- find a smaller subgroup within one of those larger buckets that is growing, has the buying power, and is easy to target ([Location 583](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B099QVG1H8&location=583))
- Think about what you are good at in regards to health, wealth, and relationships. Then think about who might value your service the most (is in the most pain), has the buying power to pay what you want (money), and can be found easily (targeting). As long as those three criteria are strong and the market isn't shrinking, you’ll be in good shape. ([Location 588](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B099QVG1H8&location=588))
- Starving Crowd (market) > Offer Strength > Persuasion Skills ([Location 596](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B099QVG1H8&location=596))
- You must pick one. No one can serve two masters. ([Location 615](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B099QVG1H8&location=615))
- All businesses and, all markets, have unpleasant characteristics. The grass is never greener once you get to the other side. If you keep hopping from niche to niche, hoping that the market will solve your problems, you deserve to be niche slapped. ([Location 616](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B099QVG1H8&location=616))
- in order to maintain product focus, and high converting messaging, knowing exactly who the product was for was a game changer. It helped us know exactly who we were speaking to at all times. And exactly whose problems we were solving. ([Location 636](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B099QVG1H8&location=636))
- ‘I solve this type of problem for this specific type of person in this unique counter-intuitive way that reverses their deepest fear.” ([Location 659](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B099QVG1H8&location=659))
- First, don't pick a bad market. Normal markets are fine. Great markets are great. Second, once you pick, commit to it until you figure it out. ([Location 665](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B099QVG1H8&location=665))
- If you try one hundred offers, I promise you will succeed. Most people never try anything. Others fail once, then give up. It takes resilience to succeed. Stop personalizing! It’s not about you! If your offer doesn’t work, it doesn’t mean you suck. It means your offer sucks. Big difference. You only suck if you stop trying. So, try again. You’ll never become world class if you stop after a failed attempt. ([Location 666](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B099QVG1H8&location=666))
- If you find a crazy good market, ride it, and ride it hard. And if you pair a Grand Slam Offer with a crazy market, you’ll likely never need to work again (seriously). So have this skill set — the ability to accurately assess markets by taking into account pain, money, targeting, and growth — in your back pocket so that when lightning strikes, you can make sure it strikes twice. ([Location 669](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B099QVG1H8&location=669))
- Making shit loads of money breaks people’s minds. It literally stretches their minds so far past what they believe is possible they assume you are doing something wrong or illegal. They literally “can’t even.” ([Location 710](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B099QVG1H8&location=710))
    - Note: It doesn't fit our model of the world.
- how to create and communicate value, aka the “worth-it-ness” of an offer. ([Location 721](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B099QVG1H8&location=721))
- The reason people buy anything is to get a deal. They believe what they are getting (VALUE) is worth more than what they are giving in exchange for it (PRICE). The moment the value they receive dips below what they are paying, they stop buying from you. This price to value discrepancy is what you need to avoid at all costs. ([Location 723](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B099QVG1H8&location=723))
- get more people to say yes at a higher price by increasing our value to price discrepancy. In other words, we will raise our price only after we have sufficiently increased our value. This way, they still get a great deal ([Location 732](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B099QVG1H8&location=732))
- competitors they are copying are dead broke. So why on earth copy them? ([Location 743](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B099QVG1H8&location=743))
- we are not trying to get the most customers. We are trying to make the most money. ([Location 751](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B099QVG1H8&location=751))
- When you raise your price, you increase the value the consumer receives without changing anything else about your product. ([Location 777](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B099QVG1H8&location=777))
- In essence, raising your prices can directly enhance the value you provide. What’s more, the higher the price, the more allure your product or service has. People want to buy expensive things. They just need a reason. And the goal isn’t just to be slightly above the market price — the goal is to be so much higher that a consumer thinks to themselves, “This is so much more expensive, there must be something entirely different going on here.” ([Location 784](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B099QVG1H8&location=784))
- you offer a service where a customer must do something in order to achieve the result, or solve the problem you say you solve, they must be invested. The more invested they are, the more likely they are to achieve the positive result. Therefore, it follows that if you care about your customers, you should get them as invested as humanly possible. Ideally, this means pricing your services or product in such a way that it stings a little when they buy. That sting will force and focus their attention and their investment in your product or service. Those who pay the most, pay the most attention. ([Location 789](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B099QVG1H8&location=789))
- you must outwork your self doubt. You must be so confident in your delivery, because you have done it so many times, that you know that this person will succeed. Experience is what gives you the conviction to ask for someone’s entire year’s salary as payment. You must believe so deeply in your solution that when you look at yourself in the mirror at night, alone, your conviction remains unshakable. ([Location 797](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B099QVG1H8&location=797))
- my conviction was stronger than their skepticism. ([Location 819](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B099QVG1H8&location=819))
- We were able to charge a premium because we provided more value than anyone else in the industry. In a real way, we were charging on a fraction of what our clients made using our system. This is important. Our clients still got a deal. The gap between what they paid (price) and what they got (value) was massive. ([Location 828](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B099QVG1H8&location=828))
- In order to charge so much, though, you must learn to create tremendous value. ([Location 835](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B099QVG1H8&location=835))
- Many entrepreneurs believe that charging “too much” is bad. The reality is that, yes, you should never charge more than your product is worth. But you should charge far more for your product and services than it costs to fulfill it. Think up to a hundred times more, not just two or three times more. And if you provide enough value, it should still always be a steal for the prospect. That is the power of value. It unleashes unlimited pricing and profit power to scale your company. ([Location 851](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B099QVG1H8&location=851))
- (Yay) The Dream Outcome (Goal: Increase) (Yay) Perceived Likelihood of Achievement (Goal: Increase) (Boo) Perceived Time Delay Between Start and Achievement (Goal: Decrease) (Boo) Perceived Effort & Sacrifice (Goal: Decrease) ([Location 873](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B099QVG1H8&location=873))
- What will I make? (Dream Outcome) How will I know it's going to happen? (Perceived Likelihood of Achievement) How long will it take? (Time Delay) What is expected of me? (Effort & Sacrifice) ([Location 877](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B099QVG1H8&location=877))
- if you can reduce your prospects' true time delay to receiving value to zero (aka you realize your immediate dream outcome), and your effort and sacrifice is zero, you have an infinitely valuable product. If you accomplish this, you win the game. ([Location 891](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B099QVG1H8&location=891))
- The Grand Slam Offer only becomes valuable once the prospect perceives the increase in likelihood of achievement, perceives the decrease in time delay, and perceives the decrease in effort and sacrifice. ([Location 900](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B099QVG1H8&location=900))
- “Any fool can sell a product by offering it for a discount, it takes great marketing to sell the same product for a premium” Logical solution: make trains faster to increase satisfaction Psychological solution: decrease the pain of waiting by adding a dotted map Psychological solution: pay models to be the hostesses on the trip (people would wish it took longer to get to their destination!) Logical solution: make elevator faster Psychological solution: add floor to ceiling mirrors so people are distracted staring at themselves and forget how long they were on the elevator Logical solution: make it cheaper Psychological solution: make fewer of them and raise the price which causes people to want it more. ([Location 912](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B099QVG1H8&location=912))
- Our goal is not to create desire. It’s simply to channel that desire through our offer and monetization vehicle. ([Location 927](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B099QVG1H8&location=927))
    - Note: Dont create demand, find it
- It’s the gap between their current reality and their dreams. Our goal is to accurately depict that dream back to them, so they feel understood, and explain how our vehicle will get them there. ([Location 929](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B099QVG1H8&location=929))
    - Note: Make them feel understood
- the dream outcome that most directly increases a prospect’s status will be the one they value most. ([Location 942](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B099QVG1H8&location=942))
- For many men, making money is more important than being handsome. Why? Because money drives status for men more than being handsome does. So, in general, they will value all offers that make them money more than offers that help them look good. ([Location 943](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B099QVG1H8&location=943))
    - Note: Look for innate desires and create an offer around it
- So it’s not about the money, it's about the status (the perceived increase or decrease in relative standing when compared to others socially or professionally). Talk in terms of things your prospect believes will increase their status, and you will have your prospects drooling. ([Location 949](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B099QVG1H8&location=949))
- Frame benefits in terms of status gained from the viewpoint of others When writing copy, you can make it that much more powerful by talking about how other people will perceive the prospect’s achievement. Connect the dots for them. Example: If you buy this golf club, your drive will increase by 40 yards. Your golf buddies' jaws will drop when they see your ball soar 40 yards past theirs . . . they’ll ask you what’s changed . . . only you will know. ([Location 951](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B099QVG1H8&location=951))
- people pay for certainty. They value certainty. I call this “the perceived likelihood of achievement.” In other words, “How likely do I believe it is that I will achieve the result I am looking for if I make this purchase?” ([Location 962](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B099QVG1H8&location=962))
- how much would you pay to be a plastic surgeon’s 10,000th patient versus their first? If you're a normal, sane person, a lot more. I mean heck, you might even ask them to pay you if you are their first patient ever. So you can see even from this simple example that while the service you are receiving is technically the same, the only thing that changes is your perceived likelihood of getting what you want. ([Location 964](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B099QVG1H8&location=964))
    - Note: Perceived authority
- People value this perceived likelihood of achievement. Increasing a prospect’s conviction that your offer will “actually” work for them, will make your offer that much more valuable even though the work remains the same on your end. So to increase value with all offers, we must communicate perceived likelihood of achievement through our messaging, proof, what we choose to include or exclude in our offer, and our guarantees (more on these later). ([Location 970](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B099QVG1H8&location=970))
- The shorter the distance between when they purchase and they receive value/the outcome, the more valuable your services or product is. ([Location 974](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B099QVG1H8&location=974))
- There are two elements to this driver of value: Long-term outcome and short-term experience. Many times, there are short-term experiences that occur while en route to the long-term outcomes. They happen “along the way” and provide value. ([Location 975](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B099QVG1H8&location=975))
- The thing people buy is the long-term value, aka their “dream outcome.” But the thing that makes them stay long enough to get it is the short-term experience. These are little milestones a prospect sees along the way that shows them they are on the right path. We try and tie as many of these as possible into any service we offer. We want clients to have a big emotional win early (as close as possible to their purchase). This gives them the emotional buy in and the momentum to “see it through” to their ultimate goal. ([Location 977](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B099QVG1H8&location=977))
- For example, it takes a while to add an extra $239,000 per year to a gym. But that’s what they’re buying. So, once they have purchased, we need to create emotional wins fast. One way we do this is to get their ads live and get them to close their first $2,000 sale within their first seven days. By doing this, their decision to work with us is reinforced, and they immediately trust us more. This makes them more likely to follow the rest of our systems and get to their ultimate destination. ([Location 981](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B099QVG1H8&location=981))
- Always try and incorporate short-term, immediate wins for a client. Be creative. They just need to know they are on the right path and that they made the right decision trusting you and your business. ([Location 986](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B099QVG1H8&location=986))
- The only thing that beats “free” is “fast.” People will pay for speed. ([Location 999](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B099QVG1H8&location=999))
    - Note: People value time more than money
- People believe that if an expert does it, then they will be more likely to achieve the outcome than if they try on their own. ([Location 1017](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B099QVG1H8&location=1017))
- People are more willing to pay $200 for supplements than they are a $29/mo membership. Taking a pill, or drinking a shake, is so much faster and easier than going to the gym everyday. Hence . . . valued. ([Location 1034](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B099QVG1H8&location=1034))
- you can either sit there and make “complain” posts about how people “ought” to be a certain way. Or you can take advantage of the way people are and capitalize. This book is for those people who want to be victors, not victims of circumstances. ([Location 1036](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B099QVG1H8&location=1036))
- You can either be right or you can be rich. ([Location 1038](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B099QVG1H8&location=1038))
- knowing what people value versus what is good for them is key. It means you can find ways to monetize the things that people value in order to give them what they really need. ([Location 1040](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B099QVG1H8&location=1040))
- life will pay you for your ability to solve using a divergent thought process. In other words, think of many solutions to a single problem. ([Location 1085](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B099QVG1H8&location=1085))
- if I were selling a brick, I would find out what my customer’s desire was, and then devise how many ways I could create value with my “brick.” ([Location 1120](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B099QVG1H8&location=1120))
- Step #1: Identify Dream Outcome ([Location 1137](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B099QVG1H8&location=1137))
- Step #2: List Problems ([Location 1142](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B099QVG1H8&location=1142))
- When listing out problems, think about what happens immediately before and immediately after someone uses your product/service. What's the “next” thing they need help with? These are all the problems. Think about it in insane detail. If you do, you will create a more valuable and compelling offer as you’ll continually be answering people’s next problem as it manifests.. ([Location 1143](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B099QVG1H8&location=1143))
- Now, go ahead and list out all the problems your prospect has. Don’t let these buckets, which are just meant to get your brain going, constrain you. ([Location 1163](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B099QVG1H8&location=1163))
- What I showed here isn’t just four problems, though. We have 16 core problems with two to four sub problems underneath. So 32 to 64 problems total. Yowza. No wonder most people don't achieve their goals. Do not get overwhelmed. This is the best news ever. The more problems you think of, the more problems you get to solve. ([Location 1165](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B099QVG1H8&location=1165))
- So, to recap, just list out each core thing that someone has to do. Then think of all the reasons they wouldn't be able to do it, or keep doing it (using the four value drivers as a guide). ([Location 1168](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B099QVG1H8&location=1168))
- Creating the solutions list has two steps. First, we are going to first transform our problems into solutions. Second, we are going to name these solutions. ([Location 1171](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B099QVG1H8&location=1171))
- turn them into solutions by thinking, “What would I need to show someone to solve this problem?” ([Location 1173](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B099QVG1H8&location=1173))
- if this is your first Grand Slam Offer, it’s important to over-deliver like crazy. ([Location 1221](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B099QVG1H8&location=1221))
- “Create flow. Monetize flow. Then add friction.” This means I generate demand first. Then, with my offer, I get them to say yes. Once I have people saying yes, then, and only then, will I add friction in my marketing, or decide to offer less for the same price. ([Location 1231](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B099QVG1H8&location=1231))
- create cash flow by over-delivering like crazy at first. Then use the cash flow to fix your operations and make your business more efficient. ([Location 1248](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B099QVG1H8&location=1248))
- For the purposes of keeping creativity high (divergent thinking), think about anything you could possibly do. Think of all the things that might enhance the value of your offer. So much so that they would be stupid to say no. ([Location 1257](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B099QVG1H8&location=1257))
- What level of personal attention do I want to provide? one-on-one, small group, one to many What level of effort is expected from them? Do it themselves (DIY) - figure out how to do it on their own; do it with them (DWY) - you teach them how to do it; done for them (DFY) - you do it for them If doing something live, what environment or medium do I want to deliver it in? In-person, phone support, email support, text support, Zoom support, chat support If doing a recording, how do I want them to consume it? Audio, video, or written. How quickly do we want to reply? On what days? during what hours? 24/7. 9-5, within 5 minutes, within an hour, within 24 hrs? 10x to 1/10th test. If my customers paid me 10x my price (or $100,000) what would I provide? If they paid me 1/10th the price and I had to make my product more valuable than it already is, how would I do that? How could I still make them successful for 1/10th price? Stretch your mind in either direction and you’ll come up with widely different solutions. ([Location 1292](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B099QVG1H8&location=1292))
- Don’t get romantic about how you want to solve the problem. Find a way to solve every problem a prospect presents with. When you do that, you make an offer that’s so good, people just can't say no. ([Location 1315](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B099QVG1H8&location=1315))
- You must resolve every obstacle a buyer believes they will have to convert the highest amount of people. That’s not to say that if you don't, you won’t sell people. Not at all. But you won't sell as many people as you otherwise could have. And that’s the goal, to sell the most people, for the highest possible price, with the highest possible margin. ([Location 1317](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B099QVG1H8&location=1317))
- I look at the cost of providing these solutions to me (the business). I remove the ones that are high cost and low value first. Then I remove low cost, low value items. ([Location 1321](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B099QVG1H8&location=1321))
- which of these things will this person: Financially value Cause them to believe they will be likely to succeed Make them feel like they can do it with much less effort and sacrifice Help them accomplish their goal and see the result they want with far less time investment. ([Location 1323](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B099QVG1H8&location=1323))
- If there’s one type of delivery vehicle to focus on, it’s creating high value, “one to many” solutions. These will be the ones that typically have the biggest discrepancy between cost and value. ([Location 1332](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B099QVG1H8&location=1332))
- Solves all the perceived problems (not just some) Gives you the conviction that what you’re selling is one of a kind (very important) Makes it impossible to compare or confuse your business or offering with the one down the street ([Location 1390](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B099QVG1H8&location=1390))
- “When demand increases, cut supply.” ([Location 1439](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B099QVG1H8&location=1439))
- When we increase the demand, we can sell more units. When we decrease supply, we can sell those units for more money. The “perfect profit combination” is lots of demand, and very little supply, or perceived supply. The process of enhancing your core offer is designed to do both of these things: increase demand and decrease perceived supply so that you can sell the same products for more money than you otherwise could, and in higher volumes than you otherwise would (over a longer time horizon). ([Location 1458](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B099QVG1H8&location=1458))
- “Desire is a contract you make with yourself to be unhappy until you get what you want.” ([Location 1466](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B099QVG1H8&location=1466))
- only want things we do not have. As soon as we have them, our desire for them disappears. Therefore, if we seek to increase the demand (or desire), we must decrease or delay satisfying the desires of our prospects. We must sell fewer units than we otherwise can. ([Location 1466](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B099QVG1H8&location=1466))
- The longer you delay the ask, the bigger the ask you can make. ([Location 1489](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B099QVG1H8&location=1489))
- We must endeavor to keep our supply (and satisfaction of desire) under the demand that we are able to generate. This maximizes profits and keeps desire ravenous in our customer base. This is the real key to never going hungry. ([Location 1491](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B099QVG1H8&location=1491))
- If you satisfy zero desire (provide zero supply), you will not make money, and eventually leave people feeling rejected (Note: it takes much longer than you think). ([Location 1494](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B099QVG1H8&location=1494))
- if you satisfy all the demand, you will kill your golden goose, and not know where your next meal will come from. ([Location 1495](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B099QVG1H8&location=1495))
- The reason an authority (like a doctor), a celebrity (like Oprah), or a celebrity authority (like Dr.Oz or Dr.Phil) can charge egregious rates is because of implied demand. People assume that there is a lot of demand for their time, and, therefore, not a big supply of it. As a result, it must be expensive. ([Location 1514](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B099QVG1H8&location=1514))
- If I have a rare problem, and I must solve this problem for my own pursuit of happiness, it will consume all of my attention. By the nature of my problem being specialized, there will be very few people who can solve it. This means there is not a large supply of solvers. In many cases, I will perceive only one possible “solver” (Supply = 1). ([Location 1522](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B099QVG1H8&location=1522))
- The person who needs the exchange less always has the upper hand. I always try to remember that. It’s one of the negotiating and pricing principles that has best served me in my life. ([Location 1550](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B099QVG1H8&location=1550))
- it’s better to sell out consistently than over order and fail at creating that scarcity. This method stacks in effectiveness if it is done repeatedly over time (just not too often). Once a month seems to be the sweet spot for most of the companies that I know who do this with regularity. ([Location 1569](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B099QVG1H8&location=1569))
- When using this tactic, you must also let everyone know that you sold out. That is part of what makes it work so well. This way, even people who were on the fence, when they see that it was sold out, it gives social proof that other people thought it was worth it. And now that the choice has been made for them, they desire it more because there is no way they can get it. So the next time you make the offer they will be far more likely to take you up on it. ([Location 1571](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B099QVG1H8&location=1571))
- Only accepting X clients at this level of service (on-going). This puts a cap on how many clients you service but also keeps them in it. You create a waiting list for new prospects. The moment the door opens, they jump right in and price resistance disappears. ([Location 1580](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B099QVG1H8&location=1580))
- Only accepting X clients per week (on-going) ([Location 1586](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B099QVG1H8&location=1586))
- Only accepting….X clients per class or cohort. ([Location 1591](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B099QVG1H8&location=1591))
- have less spots available than you think you can sell . . . so that when you want to do it again in the future, everyone will remember you sold out . . . fast. This is a compounding strategy that increases in effectiveness over time. ([Location 1598](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B099QVG1H8&location=1598))
- sell a very limited supply of 1-on-1 access. ([Location 1621](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B099QVG1H8&location=1621))
- if you want to immediately make a lot of money, create a very exclusive service level based on access to you (yes, unscalable), that you cap at a tiny number. Price it very high. Then, tell people. You will make more money than you thought possible. ([Location 1623](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B099QVG1H8&location=1623))
- You can create scarcity by also capping your service level and saying that if they leave than can never return. This type of scarcity makes people think extra hard about leaving. ([Location 1628](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B099QVG1H8&location=1628))
- Scarcity is a function of quantity. Urgency is a function of time. ([Location 1636](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B099QVG1H8&location=1636))
- Rolling Cohorts, 2) Rolling Seasonal Urgency, and 3) Promotional or Pricing Urgency 4) Exploding Opportunity. They will employ urgency in your business without being phony. My favorite way of doing this is having cohorts of clients start on a regular cadence. This has the added operational benefit of helping you create a choreographed onboarding experience for new clients. As you scale, this will become increasingly important. ([Location 1640](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B099QVG1H8&location=1640))
- In a digital setting, having actual sign up date countdowns is very useful. But make sure they are real. If they aren’t, you’ll lose credibility ([Location 1668](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B099QVG1H8&location=1668))
- The actual promotion may be the same, but naming it something different “by season” gives you a “real” differentiator that gives you a start and a finish. Deadlines drive decisions. ([Location 1676](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B099QVG1H8&location=1676))
- if you talk specifically about the promotion you can often elicit the same urgency on buying in the prospect while maintaining your integrity — win-win. ([Location 1687](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B099QVG1H8&location=1687))
- single offer is less valuable than the same offer broken into its component parts and stacked as bonuses ([Location 1716](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B099QVG1H8&location=1716))
- Whenever trying to close a deal, never discount the main offer. It teaches your customers that your prices are negotiable (which is terrible). Adding bonuses to increase value to close the deal is far superior to cutting prices. It puts you in a position of strength and goodwill rather than weakness. ([Location 1728](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B099QVG1H8&location=1728))
- When selling one on one, you ask for the sale first, before offering the bonuses. If they say yes, then after they have signed up, you let them know the additional bonuses they're going to get. This creates a wow experience and reinforces their decision to buy. ([Location 1733](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B099QVG1H8&location=1733))
- if the person does not buy after the first ask, then you present a bonus that matches their perceived obstacle, then ask again. Don’t feel weird about asking again. You simply agree with the prospect, add the bonus, and ask if this consolation was “Fair enough.” People have a hard time rejecting reciprocity, so adding a bonus to… ([Location 1735](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B099QVG1H8&location=1735))
- each of those deliverables is now being weaponized and presented at the perfect time. We’re going to provide all these bonuses to them anyways, but it increases the perception of our offer’… ([Location 1738](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B099QVG1H8&location=1738))
- there are a few key things to remember when offering bonuses: 1. Always offer them (you can use the bulleted bundle we came up with at the end of Section III) 2. Give them a special name that has a benefit in the title 3. Tell them: a) How it relates to their issue b) What it is c) How you discovered it, or what you had to do to create it d) How it will specifically improve their lives or make their experience i) Faster, easier or less effort/sacrifice (value equation) 4. Provide some proof (this can be a stat, a past client, or personal experience) to prove that this thing is valuable 5. Paint a vivid mental image of what their life will be like assuming they have already used it and are experiencing the benefits 6. Always ascribe a price tag to them and justify it 7. Tools & checklists are better than additional trainings (as the effort & time are lower with the former, so the value is higher. The value equation still reigns supreme). 8. They should each address a specific concern/obstacle in the prospects mind about why they can’t or won’t be successful (bonus should prove their belief incorrect) 9. This can also be what they would logically realize they will need next. You want to solve their next problem before they even encounter it. 10. The value of the bonuses should eclipse the value of the core offer. Psychologically as you continue to add offers, it continues to expand the price to value discrepancy. It also, subconsciously communicates that the core… ([Location 1741](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B099QVG1H8&location=1741))
- You can get other businesses to give you their services and products as a part of your bonuses in exchange for exposure to your clients for free. This is free marketing for them, and high value products for you at no cost. Businesses will do this because you are going to give their business exposure for free to the highest quality prospects, your customers. ([Location 1768](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B099QVG1H8&location=1768))
- negotiate a group discount and a commission to yourself. ([Location 1782](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B099QVG1H8&location=1782))
- Create checklists, tools, swipe files, scripts, templates, and anything else that would take lots of time and effort to create on one’s own, but is easy to use once created. Anything that you can invest in one time that clearly cost time or money to create, but can be given away endless time is a perfect fit for a bonus. Beyond that, make a habit to record every workshop, every webinar, every event, every interview and use them as additional bonuses (as needed to crush a perceived obstacle). Proactively negotiate group discounts and a referral commission with adjacent businesses that solve needs your customer will have as a result of beginning this process with you. What’s the next natural thing they might want? Go to those businesses, get a deal for them they could never get for themselves (because you are negotiating with the purchasing power of all your customers at once, very powerful). ([Location 1804](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B099QVG1H8&location=1804))
- Many times you have so much “stuff” you will be providing your customers (good thing) that valuable nuggets can get lost in the mix. You want to take the most distinct ones that can almost stand on their own and pull those out to highlight them. This is especially true for things that are short in length but high in quality or value. Checklists or infographics can condense a lot of information into a small space. Someone might not feel justified paying lots of money for a product launch map (for example) but as a bonus would be perceived as very valuable. ([Location 1818](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B099QVG1H8&location=1818))
- there are four types of guarantees: Unconditional Conditional Anti-Guarantee Implied Guarantees. ([Location 1836](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B099QVG1H8&location=1836))
- What makes a guarantee have power is a conditional statement: If you do not get X result in Y time period, we will Z. To give a guarantee teeth you have to decide what you’ll do if they don’t get the result. Without the “or what” portion of the guarantee, it sounds weak and diluted. ([Location 1854](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B099QVG1H8&location=1854))
- Implied guarantees are any offer that is a performance-based offer. This comes in many different forms. Revshare, profitshare, triggers, ratchets, monetary bonuses, etc are all examples. The end all concept is the same, if I don't perform, I don’t get paid. Unique to this particular structure, it also confers the upside of “If I do a great job, I will be very well compensated.” ([Location 1875](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B099QVG1H8&location=1875))
- “I’m not asking you to decide yes or no today...I'm asking you to make a fully informed decision, that is all. The only way you can make a fully informed decision is on the inside, not the outside. So you get on the inside and see if everything we say on this webinar is true and valuable to you. Then, if it is, that’s when you decide to keep it. If it’s not for you, no hard feelings. You will then, after signing up at URL be able to make a fully informed decision that this isn’t for you. But you can’t make this decision right now for the same reason you don't buy a house without first looking at the inside of it. And know this...whether it’s 29 min or 29 days from now...if you ain’t happy, I ain’t happy. For any reason whatsoever, if you want your money back you can get it because I only want to keep your money if you’re happy. All you have to do is go to support@xyz.com and tell use “gimme my money” and you got it, and in short order - our response times to any support request average 61min over a 24/7 time period. You can only make such a guarantee when you're confident that what you have is the real deal and I'm fairly confident that when you sign up at URL you’re getting exactly what you need to BENEFIT.” ([Location 1896](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B099QVG1H8&location=1896))
- If you are going to give a guarantee, spice it up. Instead of using “satisfaction” or some other “vanilla” word, describe it more strongly. Generic Example (Bad): 30 Day Money Back Satisfaction Guarantee. Creative Imagery Example #1 (Good): In 30 days, if you wouldn’t jump into shark infested waters to get our product back, we will return every dollar you paid. Creative Imagery Example #2 (Great): You’ll get our famous “Club a Baby Seal Guarantee”After 30 days of using our services, if you wouldn’t club a baby seal to stay on as a customer, you don’t have to pay a penny. ([Location 1906](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B099QVG1H8&location=1906))
- “Do you think I'd still be in business if I gave a crazy guarantee like that and wasn't good at what I did? Now I'm not guaranteeing you’re going to hit this goal in six weeks, after all, because I can't eat the food for you. But I am guaranteeing that you will get $500 worth of value and service from us to support you. If you don't feel like we gave you that level of service, I’ll write you a check the day you tell me we suck.” ([Location 1916](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B099QVG1H8&location=1916))
- It works perfectly with a best-case/worst-case close. “Best case you get the body of your dreams and we give you all your money towards staying with us to hit your long-term goal. Worst case you tell me I suck, I write you a check, and you get six weeks of free training. Both options are risk free. But, the only thing guaranteed not to help you is walking out of here today.” If you are good at what you do, you can use a guarantee like this to push a lot of people over the edge. ([Location 1920](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B099QVG1H8&location=1920))
- We start the name with a word or phrase that tells people the “reason why” we are running our promotion. I like to tell people to think like a fraternity party planner. When I was in college, we had a party once because a guy got his wisdom teeth removed. I say this to say. . .the “reason why” can literally be anything. ([Location 2082](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B099QVG1H8&location=2082))

- be as specific as possible, but no more. ([Location 2091](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B099QVG1H8&location=2091))
- articulate your prospect’s dream outcome. It can be a single word or a phrase. It can be an event, a feeling, an experience, or an outcome, anything that would excite them. The more specific and tangible, the better. ([Location 2095](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B099QVG1H8&location=2095))
- duration to expect here. This gives an example of how long your results will take to achieve. ([Location 2099](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B099QVG1H8&location=2099))
- The container word denotes that this offer is a bundle of lots of things put together. It’s a system. It’s something that can’t be held up to a commoditized alternative. ([Location 2107](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B099QVG1H8&location=2107))
- As you market offers, you will need to create variations over time as the tastes of the market change over time. Here’s the order in which you will change things to keep lead flow consistent. Change the creative (the images and pictures in your ads) Change the body copy in your ads Change the headline - the “wrapper” of your offer Free 6 Week Lean Challenge to Free 6 Week Tone Challenge Holiday Hangover to New Year New You Change the duration of your offer Change the enhancer of your offer (your free/discount component) Change the monetization structure, the series of offers you give prospects, and the price points associated with them (Book II) ([Location 2144](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B099QVG1H8&location=2144))
- Once you’ve monetized an offer, rarely should you change it. Just rinse and repeat over and over and over again. This can be hard because we are entrepreneurs and love change. Change here usually just creates inefficiency and operational drag, costing you money. No bueno. ([Location 2157](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B099QVG1H8&location=2157))

How to charge a lot of money using the four core value drivers. How to create your value offer in five steps. How to stack the value, deliver it, and make it profitable. How to shift the demand curve in your favor using scarcity, How to use urgency to decrease the action threshold of buyers How to strategically use bonuses to increase the demand of your offer How to completely reverse buyer risk with a creative guarantee. How to name it in a way that resonates with your avatar. ([Location 2231](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B099QVG1H8&location=2231))
