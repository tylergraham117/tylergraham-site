#### Introduction
- Dopamine is how scientists measure the addictive potential of an experience.
- The brain processes pain and pleasure in the same place.
	- They work as opposite sides of the balance.
	- *There is an intrinsic, neurochemical relationship between pleasure and pain.*
- "Persons with severe addictions are among those contemporary prophets that we ignore to our own demise, for *they show us who we truly are*." - Kent Dunnington
- "the secret to finding a balance is combining the science of desire with the wisdom of recovery."

## PART I: The Pursuit of Pleasure

#### CHAPTER ONE: Our Masturbation Machines

- Addiction is broadly defined as continued and *compulsive consumption of a substance or behavior despite its harm to self and/or others*.
- One of the biggest risk factors for getting addicted to any drug is access to it.
- Technology itself is addictive, with its flashing lights, musical fanfare, bottomless bowls, and the promise of ever greater rewards.
	- All of this seems to signal safety and greater chance of survival to the ancient parts of our brains.
- The internet promotes compulsive consumption by giving us access and by suggesting behaviors that never would've occurred to us.
- "*Seventy percent of world global deaths are attributed to modifiable behavioral risk factors like smoking, physical activity, and diet.*"
	- "The leading global risks for mortality are: high blood pressure (13%), tobacco use (9%), high blood sugar (6%), physical inactivity (6%), and obesity (5%)."
- "The poor and undereducated, especially those living in rich nations, are most susceptible to the problem of compulsive overconsumption. They have easy access to high-reward, high-potency, high-novelty drugs at the same time that they lack access to meaningful work, safe housing, quality education, affordable health care, and race and class equality before the law. This creates a dangerous nexus of addiction risk."

#### CHAPTER TWO: Running from Pain

- *Our pursuit of happiness has become a societal obsession. Everything is viewed as a vehicle for our own well being, even things like acts of kindness and altruism*.
	- Do we have to get something out of it for it to be worth doing?
- In parenting, we have shifted towards empathy and that's a good thing. 
	- We've also over sanitized childhood, removing adversity wherever possible, which is probably not a good thing.
	- We've bolstered self-esteem with false praise and a lack of real world consequences, leaving children less tolerant, more entitled, and ignorant of their own character defects.
- As a society, we've lost the ability to tolerate discomfort. We seek to distract ourselves from the present moment, to be entertained, at all times.
- Boredom is an opportunity for discovery and invention. It creates space for a new thought to form, without which we're endlessly reacting to stimuli around us rather than allowing ourselves to be within our lived experience.
- "I've seen a similar paradox in many of my patients over the years: They use drugs, prescribed or otherwise, to compensate for a basic lack of self-care, then attribute the costs to a mental illness, thus necessitating the need for more drugs. *Hence poisons become vitamins*."
- We'll do anything to distract ourselves from ourselves.
- *The reason we're all so miserable may be because we're working so hard to avoid being miserable.*

#### CHAPTER THREE: The Pleasure-Pain Balance

- Dopamine plays a bigger role in the motivation to get a reward than the reward itself. 
	- It's more about wanting than liking.
	- *Dopamine isn't so much a pleasure chemical, but a chemical of the anticipation of pleasure.*
	- It's the chemical that motivates us to seek.
- Substances and experiences trigger the release of dopamine at varying levels.
- Pleasure and pain are co-located, and they work as a balance.
	- The more the balance tips, and the faster it tips, the more pleasure we feel.
- The balance wants to remain level, in equilibrium. 
- *Homeostasis* is the tendency of any living system to maintain physiological equilibrium.
- *The reciprocal relationship between pleasure and pain is known as the opponent-process theory.*
	- "Any prolonged or repeated departures from hedonic or affective neutrality have a cost" - Richard Soloman and John Corbit
	- What goes up must come down.
- Many processes in the body are governed by similar self regulating systems. 
	- Color perception is an example. If we look at a color for a long period of time, it spontaneously produces an image of its opposing color in the viewer's eye. If we stare at a green image against a white background for a while, and then look at blank white, we'll see a red afterimage. The perception of green gives way in succession to the perception of red.
- The craving we have after pleasure is the balance happening. We naturally want to recreate the good feelings, so we keep doing whatever gave us the dopamine.
- *With repeated exposure to the same or similar pleasure stimuli, the initial deviation to the side of pleasure gets weaker and shorter and the after-response of pain gets stronger and longer. This process is known as neuroadaptation.*
	- Needing more of a substance to feel pleasure, or experiencing less pleasure at a consistent dose, is called tolerance.
- *With prolonged exposure to the pleasure side, the balance eventually gets weighed to the pain side. Our hedonic set point (pleasure point) changes as our capacity to experience pleasure goes down and our vulnerability to pain goes us.*
	- It eventually leads to a dopamine deficit state.
	- In this state, little to no dopamine is transmitted.
	- Basically, *nothing feels good anymore.*
- *Hedonism, the pursuit of pleasure for its own sake, leads to anhedonia, which is the inability to enjoy pleasure of any kind.*
	- Basically a dopamine based paradox.
- The *universal symptoms of withdrawal from addictive substances are anxiety, irritability, insomnia, and dysphoria*.
- When our balance is tilted to the pain side, we crave our drug just to feel normal again. (that is, to achieve a level balance)
- If we wait long enough, our brains readapt to the absence of the drug and reestablish our baseline homeostasis, which is a level balance. The solution is removing the substance and letting our body rebalance itself.
- *We can maintain a homeostatic dopamine balance through simple pleasures and non-routine, occasional exposure to high-dopamine activities.*
- The pleasure-pain balance is triggered not only through exposure to an activity, but by *cues associated with the activity. This is known as cue-dependent learning, or Pavlovian conditioning.*
- Dopamine is released in the brain in response to a conditioned cue well before the reward is ingested. The pre-reward dopamine spike in response to the conditioned cue explains the anticipatory pleasure we experience when we know good things are coming.
	- Right after the conditioned cue, dopamine decreases below baseline levels (towards the pain side). This *momentary dopamine mini-deficit state is what motivates us to seek the reward.*
- *Dopamine levels below baseline drive craving.*
- After a cue, if we get the expected reward, we get a larger than normal spike. If we don't, we get a larger than normal plunge. This is the letdown of unmet expectations. "An expected reward that fails to materialize is worse than a reward that was never anticipated in the first place."
- The brain encodes long-term memories of reward and their associated cues by changing the size and shape of dopamine-producing neurons. 
- Learning increases dopamine firing.
- The brain changes that occur in response to a stimulating and novel environment are similar to that of high dopamine, addictive drugs.
	- If our dopamine levels are already high before one of these experiences, they can't keep going higher. Back to back spikes result in limitations on the naturally induced ones.
- The balance is a metaphor. It's not actually that simple.
	- Depression, anxiety, and chronic pain shift the balance.
	- Not everyone starts off level.
- Our perception of pain and pleasure are heavily influenced by the meaning we ascribe to it.
- *Perception of pain influences the significance of that pain.*
- *Our minds are perfectly adapted to a world of scarcity.*
	- Without pleasure, we wouldn't seek to eat, drink, or reproduce.
- The dopamine system turns us into the ultimate pleasure seekers.
	- As a result, we've turned the world into a place of abundance, and now our brains are poorly adapted for our environment.

## PART II: Self-Binding

#### CHAPTER FOUR: Dopamine Fasting

- DOPAMINE acronym framework:
	- Data
		- Simple facts of consumption. The facts. 
	- Objectives
		- What's the point? What does the behavior do for you? Seemingly irrational behavior is rooted in some sort of personal logic. Fun, to fit in, to relieve boredom, manage strong emotions, etc.
	- Problems
		- Are there downsides to the behavior? High dopamine substances cloud our ability to assess cause and effect. Young people are especially immune to negative consequences of using these substances, but that changes with age dramatically. 
	- Abstinence
		- It takes about a month to restore the brain's reward pathway. A weeklong break doesn't do much. 
		- Any substance that stimulates the reward pathway also has the potential to change our baselines anxiety.
		- Considering current behavior in a future self context provides perspective and gives urgency. 
		- Abstinence is a necessary part of the process to restore balance. There will be a dopamine deficit state, which is a withdrawal. 
		- About 20% of people don't feel better after the dopamine fast. That just something else is going on beyond the drug. 
	- Mindfulness
		- Part of the process is that things get worse before they get better. There is always a withdrawal period, a period of dopamine deficit, and it makes you feel worse. 
		- The only thing you can do is sit with the pain, tolerate it, and be mindful.
		- We can observe the Milky Way galaxy visually, but we are also part of the Milky Way. This is kind of like mindfulness. We're observing the observer.
		- Judgement is the antithesis of mindful presence. 
	- Insight
		- By abstaining for the month, we get clarifying insight into our behavior.
