## The Four Roles We Play

"I don't think any of us should trust fate to write the story of our lives.
[[fate is a terrible writer]]." - Donald Miller


We, as people, are the people controlling our lives, and we have the responsibility to shape them how we seem fit. Meaning is a job for us.

If our life is a story, then we need to figure out what that story is about. Before we can do that, we have to understand what character we are playing.

The character we play determines the quality of our story.

There are 4 internal archetypes. 4 primary types of characters.
- Victim: Feels like they have no way out.
- Villain: Makes others feel small.
- Hero: Willing to face challenges and transform.
- Guide: Helps the hero.

##### Victim

- Your lead character cannot act like a victim. That's a terrible main character.
- A story has to move forward to be interesting.
- Real victimhood is real, but it's a temporary state.


##### Villain
- Heroes and villains often have similar backstories. The difference is how they choose to get 
out of their victimhood. 
- Carrying pain they haven't dealt with.
- Seeks vengeance against the world that hurt them.
- We are being villains when we dismiss others or think of them as lesser, or reduce them to outward appearances rather than understanding them. 


##### Hero
- Wants something out of life and is willing to accept challenges in order to transform into someone capable of getting what they want.
- A story moves forward when a hero responds with purposeful action and a sense of hope.
- Curiosity is often the seed of greatness. 


##### Guide
- The guide is a hero near the end of his journey.
- We live to pass our understanding of life on to those who come behind us so their stories can be better than ours. This is the point of the guide.
- It is meaningful to sacrifice ourselves for the sake of another.


"One of the great tragedies a person can experience is to feel dispassionate about their own life." 

In life, we should [[think of ourselves as characters in a story]]. Everyone fits one of these 4 archetypes.

## Accepting Your Agency

- If we think of ourselves as a victim and assume the world will change for us, then we get an excuse not to try. 
- Locus of Control
	- Internal vs External: A scale of how much we think we can control in life.
- Part of finding meaning is accepting your [[agency]]. 
	- Agency isn't someone bestowed upon us. It's not something we receive from some external source. Instead, [[agency is a decision]]. And [[we forget our agency when we don't exercise it]]. 
	- You intentionally put yourself into experiences and adventures that lead to a better life.
	- You create a goal and overcome the challenges to achieve it.
	- Push the plot forward. 
- Life has meaning if you structure it so you experience it.
	- Often, [[meaning is derived from intentional experiences]].
- The opposite of this is nihilism, thinking life has no meaning. Whatever you believe is true, because [[everything is a waste of time unless you decide it isn't]].
- We grow up in an environment that tells us our roll within the story. We go to school, we go to soccer practice, etc. Then, at some point, that script runs out, and we're just left to write the story ourselves. How do we learn to dream up meaningful experiences? #note/question‚ùì 
	- We have to practice is by taking action on whatever ideas come our way until we have a better grasp of it. It's about exposing ourselves to as many experiences as possible. 
	- After a while, we become uninterested in our own story, largely because it's uninteresting. The antidote to this is to be more curious, and to really engage in our own life.
- It's not about always being happy or avoiding challenges. It's about experiencing a sense of purpose and meaning. It's about feeling like our life matters.
- Characters who do hard things transform. Hard things change us.

## A Life of Meaning
- Meaning isn't a thought experiment. Instead, it's experienced in motion.
	- Studying love doesn't make you fall in love. You have to actually experience it.
- Meaning is something you experience on an adventure. Intentional forward momentum brings a sense of meaning.
- We have to build a habit of taking action. This is identity based. You have to become the type of person that does hard things. You become that by doing a couple hard things.
	- Trick your dopamine response into favoring meaningful action.
- Our overarching story is a collection of smaller stories. When one story ends, a new one begins. We have to make sure that the new one is just as good.
- After we do something meaningful or adventurous, we have a tendency to want to bask in that for a while. This is a mistake. Time marches on without you, and you're sitting there without a new story. 
	- You have to start writing the next page.
- "Even after a great adventure, we must all dream up something new."
- When we can't find a way to experience meaning, we distract ourselves with pleasure.

#### A Formula for Meaning
1. Take action creating work or doing something. (Do something. Take action.)
2. Experience something or encounter someone that you find captivating and that pulls you out of yourself. (Be interested in others.)
3. Have an optimistic attitude towards the challenges that are inevitable. (Embrace hardship with the understand of it's benefit.)

- When you take on a challenge with others, you forge a richer relationship.
- Challenges have a sense of meaning built in. It's an easy framework for accessing meaning at anytime. Need some meaning? Do something hard.
- We can experience meaning any time we start living a story and lean into it.
- Prompts to create meaningful experiences:
	- Think about a project that demanded your attention and was fascinating.
	- When have you been mesmerized by the beauty of life and the people around you?
	- Ability to reflect on suffering and identify how it enriched your life in the end?
- Questions like "Why are we here?" and "Why is life so empty?" are none of our business. When we experience meaning, we don't ask these questions.
- You know you're experiencing meaning when life feels like it matters.
	- You feel like you're playing an important role in an important story.
- We don't experience meaning by studying meaning. It's experienced through action.
- The most interesting people are trying to build something. They have a goal and are willing to overcome challenges.
- It's easy to connect with people in motion when you're also in motion.
- Life can be lived strategically. We just have to define an ambition and move towards it. 
	- What would a character in this situation do next?
- When you get moving, life meets you halfway and opportunities get easier to come by.

##### A formula for meaning, restated.
1. Create work, or do a deed. Find a reason to get out of bed in the morning. Make something. Put yourself in a good story.
2. Experience something with others. It's important to feel like we're not alone in the world. While being laser focused helps goals, we have to leave a little room for other people.
3. Choose a perspective towards circumstances that is positive. There is no negative event that can occur that could not somehow be redeemed. From the ashes of our tragedies we can create something beautiful. Pain is a transformative force.

We have to process challenges and understand how they have transformed us for them to be useful.


- "At some point life stops handing us prewritten cultural scripts. The credits roll." Most people don't really do much beyond that.
- This is why midlife crises occur. It's when we fail to write a new story for ourselves.
- Even when we do have cultural scripts, they are just the default. It's more fulfilling to write your own version of them. Being intentional is always a better alternative.

- "It's not our right to question whether or not life has meaning, rather it is life that questions us: Will you make your life meaningful or will you suffer the existential vacuum?" 
	- We don't get to interrogate life. It's the other way around. We're the ones on the spot.

A life of meaning is achieved when we have an ambition, share it with others, and learn to accept the challenges that come with it. 


## Elements of Transformation
- Human beings are designed to change. When we don't, it's a sign that something is terribly wrong.
- In the hero's journey, there is always an initial refusal of the call. Then, an *inciting incident* pushes them into the story. We can manufacture these for ourselves. This is the point of an adventure.
- The hero of a story has to want something. This often starts with curiosity. "I wonder if I could..."
- How do we reboot the desire to dream? How do we cultivate a habit of being curious?
	- Many of us have stopped wanting things because we believe it's out of our ability. We've lived a life where we've been told what's impossible for so long that we've stopped thinking we could do anything.
- Living a story is the only way to transform. You can't think your way through it.
- A [[story is a character that wants something and overcomes conflict to get it]]
- The character must want something specific. This is massive. At any point, if you don't know what you want, then you're not living a good story.
- When the hero defines what they want, that's a "story question." Will the hero get it?
- If you and those around you don't know what they want, then the story gets boring. 
- I often think of not wanting anything as rest. That's not accurate. Wanting rest *is* wanting something: rest. Not wanting anything is emotionally painful. You sit there and have no meaningful purpose in life. That's exhausting, not rest.
- *We find meaning in the pursuit of what we want.*
	- The act of pursuing gives us meaning, not actually getting it.
	- This means that it doesn't matter what the thing is that we want, there just has to be something.
	- "... it's the thing we want to bring into the world that invites us into life itself."
- Find out what you enjoy. It's a lot, even if you don't know off the top of your head. You have to sit down and build a vision for your life in words.
- When you file for a flight plan, you have to tell them where you're headed. What's the destination? You're allowed to cancel that plan at any point along the way. Don't be in the sky without a place to go.
- In your want, include the how. If you want to get into shape, make an adventure out of it. If you want to learn something, do something that requires that skill. 
- Learn from mistakes. See them as a curriculum rather than self judgement.
- A hero transforms by setting a specific ambition, engaging with the challenges, and learning from mistakes.
	- Life isn't all that hard. This is really all you need to do.
- The only things that don't change are dead things. Rocks don't change because they're not alive. 
	- **Even rocks change. They're inanimate, molded by their surroundings over time.**
	- Everything changes. The difference between things that are alive and things that are not is where the change comes from. Living things have the ability to change from within. If we don't take advantage of that then we're the same as something that isn't alive like a rock.
- Ask people: "What are you trying to build? What are you bringing into the world that wasn't there before? What are you creating, or what do you want to create?"

## A Hero Knows What They Want
- Good stories pose questions that are interesting enough to hold our attention.
- If there is no interesting question for us to engage in, we lose interest in our lives just like we would a movie.
- When you're interested in your own story, other people's stories don't feel threatening. 
	- We stop comparing ourselves in a negative light.
	- It's not a zero sum. We all have the ability to live interesting lives. There's not a limited amount of interesting and meaning out there.
- Some people find it hard to want things:
	- Maybe they grew up thinking resources are finite and scarce, so by wanting something they are taking it from someone else.
	- Some people are paralyzed by choice.
	- Some people are confused because they were raised in a strict environment, but grew up and realized it wasn't for them.
- Don't be ashamed to want something. 
- Desire is only negative when we desire things outside of our area of control.
- We are fueled by mixed motives: selfishness and altruism dance together to lead to meaningful action.
- Being authentic is important. We don't like people or characters who are better than us. Everyone has struggles, and sharing those struggles makes us relate to others better.
- We should make doing good a habit. There has to be an intentional push towards this.
- You can do anything, but not everything. You have to be willing to make choices and do something with commitment.
- Be a quitter. Abandoning stories that don't interest you allows you to find a new one that does. On the flip side, it's not always sunshine and rainbows, so make sure you're quitting because you don't see meaning in it, not because it's hard. 
	- Building up a tolerance for hard things is useful to see the right choices in these moments.
- Meaning sometimes comes at the cost of freedom. Everything has a price, especially meaning. But there are few things more valuable than meaning. Meaning is centered in love. 
	- What would you give up your freedom to build?
	- Creating costs time and energy.
- Ask "what if.." questions.
	- What if is a question that leads to adventure and curiosity.
