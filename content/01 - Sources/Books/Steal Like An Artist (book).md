### Information Dump

##### Chapter 1
- "All advice is autobiographical."
	- "It's on of my theories that when people give you advice, they're really just talking to themselves in the past."
	- Flip this around: If you need an idea, thing about what you wish you could tell your younger self. If you needed it, someone else probably does too.
- "...stop worrying about what's 'good' and 'bad' - there's only stuff worth stealing, and stuff that's not worth stealing."
	- Good and bad are subjective. A better way to think about things in the world are 'does this inspire me?' or 'how will this influence me?' or 'is this useful?' If the answer is yes, channel that into creating something. If the answer is no, move on to the next.
- "Nothing is original."
	- If something seems original, you're probably just unfamiliar with the source material/references.
	- "All creative work builds on what came before."
	- "Everything that needs to be said has already been said. But, since no one was listening, everything must be said again." - Andre Gide
	- "If we're free from the burden of trying to be completely original, we can stop trying to make something out of nothing, and we can embrace influence instead of running away from it."
- "You are, in fact, a mashup of what you choose to let into your life. You are the sum of your influences."
	- We get to choose our influences. It's important to be conscious of what we let in, because they will directly impact what can come out.
- Family Tree of Influences
	- "Study everything there is to know about that thinker. Then find three people that thinker loved, and find out everything about them. Repeat this as many times as you can."
	- When reading, go into the references and follow the line of research or inspiration. You can do this with anything.
	- In order to learn a subject or a discipline, learn about specific people and follow their tree of influences.
	- "Seeing yourself as part of a creative lineage will help you feel less alone as you start making your own stuff." *Creative Lineage*
- "You have to be curious about the world in which you live. Look things up. Chase down every reference. Go deeper than anybody else - that's how you'll get ahead."
	- Go deep, follow the line of references.
- "There's a magic in being surrounded by books."
- "Collect books, even if you don't plan on reading them right away. Nothing is more important than an unread library. Don't worry about doing research. Just search."
- "Keep a swipe file."
	- Keep track of the things you take from others. Have a place for these things to live. Keep track of who you took it from so you can give attribution.

##### Chapter 2
- "In my experience, it's in the act of making things and doing our work that we figure out who we are."
	- We don't discover who we are, we build it. We are a combination of influences and experiences and what we do with those.
	- "We learn to write by copying down the alphabet. Musicians learn to play by scales. Painters learn to paint by reproducing masterpieces."
- "Those who do not want to imitate anything, produce nothing." - Salvador Dali
- "You don't just want to look like your heroes, you want to see like your heroes."
	- Learn to understand the lenses through which your heroes see the world. 
	- "The reason to copy your heroes and their style is so that you might somehow get a glimpse into their minds. That's what you really want - to internalize their way of looking at the world."
- There's a difference between good and bad theft. Good theft honors, credits, transforms, and steals from many sources. Bad theft degrades, plagiarizes, imitates, and steals from one source. 


##### Chapter 3
- "Write the book you want to read."
	- Make what you'd want to consume. 
- "Whenever you're at a loss for what move to make next, just ask yourself, 'What would make a better story?'" 
	- Similar to ideas in [[A Million Miles in a Thousand Years]] by [[Donald Miller]]
- When looking for ideas on what to make, "Think about your favorite work and your creative heroes. What did they miss? What didn't they make? What could've been made better?"
	- Find inspiration by critiquing the work of your heroes. Find holes in what they've done, and fill them.

##### Chapter 4
- Making is a physical act.
	- "We need to move, to feel like we're making something with our bodies, not just our heads."
	- If we're struggling to come up with ideas, moving our bodies can be super helpful. It's like push starting a car. Mood follows action. If we change our actions, it will change our feelings.
- Digital spaces are great for editing ideas, but analog spaces really help to generate them. Incorporate both into the creative process.
	- Kleon has two desks. One has analog, one digital. They're kept intentionally separate.
		- Analog is for play, digital is for work/editing.

##### Chapter 5
- Doing mundane things like cleaning can help spark creativity.
	- "Creative people need time to just sit around and do nothing. I get some of my best ideas when I'm bored, which is why I never take my shirts to the cleaners."
- Don't cut out any part of your life that interests you. 
	- "Keep all your passions in your life."
- "It's important to have a hobby. A hobby is something creative that's just for you. You don't try to make money or get famous off it, you just do it because it makes you happy. A hobby is something that gives but doesn't take."
	- A hobby gives you live, not the other way around. "No pressure, no plans. It's regenerative."

##### Chapter 6
- "In the beginning, obscurity is good."
	- "...you learn that most of the world doesn't necessarily care about what you think."
	- "It's not that people are mean or cruel, they're just busy." - Steven Pressfield
	- People are busy. Attention is limited. To get someone's attention for any period of time long enough to understand your ideas is a gift. Until you have some reputation, nobody will be paying attention.
- Formula for becoming known: "Do good work and share it with people."
	- "Put your stuff on the internet."
- "Step 1: Wonder at something. Step 2: Invite others to wonder with you."
- "The more open you are about sharing your passions, the closer people will feel to your work. Artists aren't magicians. There's no penalty for revealing your secrets."
	- Invite people into your process. [[Show Your Work!]]
- Wonder at unique things. Invite others to join you. Share your secrets.

##### Chapter 7
- Pay attention and the world will reveal itself to you. 
	- In Colorado, Christopher told us to just sit in nature and it will reveal itself.
	- Lion Tracker's Guide, you don't find jaguars unless they want you to.
- "I always carry a book, a pen, and a notepad, and I always enjoy my solitude and temporary captivity."
	- The value of taking physical notes is the disconnection from the internet. It allows you to pay better attention to the physical world around you.
- While geography once shaped all of human civilization, it now serves more as a set of guidelines. Lessons of History.
- "Travel makes the world look new, and when the world looks new, our brains work harder."

##### Chapter 8
- Talk good behind people's backs.
- "If you ever find that you're the most talented person in the room, you need to find another room."
- Write about people you admire. Thank them publicly. Share what they've taught you. 
	- "Make something and dedicate it to your hero. Answer a question they've asked, solve a problem for them, or improve on their work and share it online."
- "Validation is for parking."
- Once you release something into the world, it ceases to be yours. It's a gift, no take backs.
- "So get comfortable with being misunderstood, disparaged, or ignored - the trick is to be too busy doing your work to care."

##### Chapter 9
- "It takes a lot of energy to be creative. You don't have that energy if you waste it on other stuff."
- "A day job gives you money, a connection to the world, and a routine."
	- All three of these are useful, especially the connection to the world.
- Do jobs that teach you meta-skills that you can bring forward. 
- "Establishing and keeping a routine can be even more important than having a lot of time."
	- Stopping kills creativity. You have to take advantage of momentum. Habits keep momentum.
- "The small details will help you remember the big details."
	- Memories need a catalyst to pull them out of the brain.

##### Chapter 10
- "Nothing is more paralyzing than the idea of limitless possibilities."
- "The way to get over creative block is to simply place some constraints on yourself."
	- Give yourself rules and you'll naturally try to come up with something creative within them. 
	- You can't think outside the box without a box.
	- Self imposed restraints are helpful. Externally imposed restraints turn into excuses, but self imposed ones turn into creativity.
