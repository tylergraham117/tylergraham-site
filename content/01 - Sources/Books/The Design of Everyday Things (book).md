# The Design of Everyday Things (book)
*Don Norman*


### Summary
Fantastic primer on intention, human centered design. I only read the first half because, at the time of reading I was looking for specific information for a specific, non design related project. I'd love to revisit this book under the perspective of design a physical object.

### Chapter 1: The Psychopathology of Everyday Things
- The two most important characteristics of good design are discoverability and understanding.
	- Discoverability: "Is it possible to figure out what actions are possible and where and how to perform them?"
	- Understanding: "What does it all mean? How is the product supposed to be used? What do all the different controls and settings mean?"
- Many products defy understanding simply because they have too many functions and controls. 
	- Like stoves and washing machines looking like a spaceship.
#### The Complexity of Modern Devices
- All artificial things are designed. Some group of people had to decide on layout, operation, and mechanisms.
	- Non-physical structures are designed too. Organizations and procedures and rules.
- Design can be viewed through different lenses (different specialties or niches).
	- Industrial design
	- Interaction design
	- Experience design
- Bad design is either frustrating or forces the user to conform to how the product wants us to interact.
	- Good design gets out of the way.
- Too much of design is done by engineers who know lots about technology but not enough about people.
	- Engineers are trained to think logically, but not all people do.
	- They often design for how they would like people to be, not how they actually are.
	- Everyone makes errors, so design should assume that errors will occur and work around that.
#### Human Centered Design
- New technologies, applications, and methods of interaction are constantly arising and evolving. Every evolution requires unique design techniques.
	- Innovation outpaces advances in good design.

#### Fundamental Principles of Interaction
- Great designers produce pleasurable experiences. 
	- It's about how fondly people remember an interaction.

Fundamental psychological concepts of discoverability:
- affordances
- signifiers
- constraints
- mappings
- feedback
- conceptual model

##### Affordances
The relationship between a physical object and a person.
More specifically, a relationship between the properties of an object and the capabilities of a person (or whatever is interacting with the object). 
Affordances determine how the object can be used.

- Anti affordances prevent interaction.
- To be effective, affordance and anti-affordances have to be discoverable, or perceivable.

##### Signifiers
Signifiers communicate where an action should take place.

- They are clues about how specifically to interact with something.
- They can be deliberate and intentional, like a push or pull sign on a door.
- They can also be unintentional, like a trail in the grass left by many other people's path.
- Unintentional signifiers are interesting because at the end of the day, intention doesn't matter. How people use something is what matters.

If someone can't figure out how to use something, it needs a signifier to show them.

##### Mapping
Mapping is the relationship between the elements of two sets of things. It's most important between the layout of a control layout and the device being controlled. (Think lights and switches.)

##### Feedback
Feedback is something to let a person know that the system is working on your request. It seems to combat impatience, mostly.

- Feedback communicates the results of an action to the one who took the action.
- Feedback has to be immediate. Delays lead people to give up.
- It's easy for feedback to become annoying or useless. It has to be designed intentionally.

##### Conceptual Models
A simplified explanation of how something works. It doesn't have to be complete, it just has to be useful.
- An important part of this is that your design does not lead to a misunderstanding of how the product works on a fundamental level. It's possible for a design to mislead the user into not understanding a core function of the device.


##### Paradox of Technology
The paradox of technology and challenge for the designer is that, often, technology meant to make life easier actually does the opposite because of the complicated learning curve associated with using it.


### Chapter 2:  The Psychology of Everyday Actions
- It's easy to learn a few basics steps to use a technology. But what happens when things inevitably go wrong? 
	- Do we shake it? Bang on it? Press random buttons? Turn it off?

The seven stages of an action:
1. Goal (form the goal)
2. Plan (the action)
3. Specify (the action sequence)
4. Perform (the action sequence)
5. Perceive (the state of the world)
6. Interpret (the perception)
7. Compare (compare)

Human thought is mostly unconscious.
Subconscious thought is fast, automatic, and controls skilled behaviors. 

- "Human error" is not a very useful term. It's more of communication error between design and user. 

A good rule for designers is "don't criticize unless you can do better." This leads you to try and understand how the faulty design got to that point, and makes you think about what could be done differently. It encourages examinations and thoughtful consideration.


### Chapter 3: Knowledge In The Head and In The World
- We have to combine knowledge we have with information around us to get by.
- Most things don't require much precision.
