# Where Good Ideas Come From (book)






pg31
> The scientist Stuart Kauffman has a suggestive name for the set of all those first-order combinations: "the adjacent possible." The phrase captures both the limits and the creative potential of change and innovation. In the case of prebiotic chemistry, the adjacent possible defines all those molecular reactions that were directly achievable in the primordial soup. Sunflowers and mosquitoes and brains exist outside that circle of possibility. The adjacent possible is a kind of shadow future, hovering on the edge of the present state of things, a map of all the ways in which the present can reinvent itself. Yet it is not an infinite space, or a totally open playing field.

> What the adjacent possible tells us is that at any moment the world is capable of extraordinary change, but only certain changes can happen.

[[the adjacent possible]]
Change happens one step at a time. At any give point, there are a finite number of steps. Each step leads to a new possibility of next steps. It's an ever changing landscape of potential change.
When seeking to effect change, it might be useful to layout the adjacent possible steps. This provides a set of directions on can embark on. By moving in a direction, we unlock more potential steps in that same direction.
