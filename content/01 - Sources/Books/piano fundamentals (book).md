# piano fundamentals (book)


http://www.pianofundamentals.com/book



**Over a period of more than 10 years, I kept track of these efficient practice methods and came to the realization that the most important factor for learning to play the piano is the practice methods.** Effort, time, and talent were merely secondary factors! In fact, "talent" is difficult to define and impossible to measure.

**The goal here is to make the learning process so fast that we aim to allocate 10% of practice time to technical work and 90% to making music.** 


How do musicians "make music"? **Whether we compose music or play an instrument, all music must originate in the artist's brain.** We can certainly shut our brains off and play the piano from rote memory after enough practice. That is absolutely the wrong way to make music because the level of the resulting music will be low. Many pianists have the misconception that the expensive, huge, concert grand produces its own sound with its characteristic music and therefore we must train our fingers for learning to play the piano. But the human brain is far more complex than, and superior to, any mechanical contraption in terms of musicality. The brain doesn't have the limitations of wood, felt, and metal. Therefore, it is more important to train the brain than the finger muscles, especially because any finger movement must originate as a nerve impulse in the brain. The answer to the above question is what we shall call Mental Play (MP) in this book.

**Acquiring technique is mostly a process of brain/nerve development, not development of finger strength.** 

What are some unique features of the methods of this book?

1.  They are not overly demanding, like older methods that require students to commit to a dedicated lifestyle to fit the piano instruction. In the methods of this book, students are given the tools to pick a specific procedure that will achieve a defined objective. If the methods really work, they shouldn't require a lifetime of blind faith in order to achieve proficiency!
2.  Every procedure of these methods has a physical basis (if it works, it always has one; the past problems have been in identifying the correct explanations); it must further contain the following required elements:
    1.  **Objective:** what techniques to acquire, i.e., if you can't play fast enough, or you can't trill well, you want to memorize, etc.,
    2.  **Then do:** i.e., practice hands separately, use chord attack, memorize as you practice, etc.,
    3.  **Because:** the physiological, psychological, mechanical, etc., explanations for why these methods work. For example, hands separate practice allows quick acquisition of technique by making difficult passages simpler (one hand is easier than two) and the chord attack enables instant acceleration to the final speed, etc., and
    4.  **If not:** problems that arise if uninformed methods are used, i.e., acquiring bad habits from too many repetitions, developing stress from practicing with fatigued hands, etc. Without this "If not", students can pick any other method -- why this one? We need to know what not to do because bad habits and wrong methods, not insufficient practice, are the main causes of a lack of progress.
3.  This book presents a complete, structured set of learning tools that transports you with minimum effort into the Magical Kingdom of Mental Play. Bon Voyage!


**Note that the above practice routine is an "intuitive" (or "instinctive") method.** If a person of average intelligence were marooned on an island with just a piano and decided to practice, that person would most likely devise a practice method like the one above. That is, a teacher using this type of practice routine isn't teaching anything -- the method is intuitive.
**Parents who are not informed will always force their children to use the intuitive methods.** This is one reason why good teachers always ask parents to accompany their children to the lessons. If the parents are not informed, there is a virtual guarantee that they will force the students to use methods that are in direct contradiction to the teacher's instructions.

## How to Learn a New Piece

### Start by Analyzing Music

Count the bars. Mark every 10. Analyze the sheet. Look for problem areas, patterns, etc.

The criticism that listening first is some sort of "cheating" has no defensible basis. The purported disadvantage is that students might end up imitating instead of using their creativity. **It is impossible to imitate someone else's playing because playing styles are so individualistic.**

**the ability to estimate the time needed to completely learn a piece is critically important to the success of the practice routine.**

**The secret for acquiring technique quickly lies in knowing certain tricks for reducing impossibly difficult passages to not only playable but often to trivially simple ones.**

### Practice the Most Difficult Sections First

**A most important learning trick is to choose a short practice segment.** This trick has perhaps the largest effect on reducing the practice time because of many reasons.

**Within a difficult passage of say, 10 bars, there are typically only a few note combinations that stymie you. There is no need to practice anything other than those notes.**

**Practicing short segments allows you to practice it dozens, even hundreds of times, in a matter of minutes.** Use of these quick repetitions is the fastest way to teach your hand new motions. If the difficult notes are played as part of a longer segment, the longer interval between repeats and the playing of other notes in between can confuse the hand and cause it to learn more slowly.

Practice small sections faster than you would normally play. It's like training harder than a race.


### Technique - HS and HT

**Essentially 100% of technique development is accomplished by practicing hands separately (HS).** Do not try to develop finger/hand technique hands together (HT) as that is much more difficult, time consuming, and dangerous, as explained in detail later.

Choose two short passages, one each for the right hand (RH) and the left hand (LH). **Practice the RH until it begins to tire, then switch to the LH. Switch every 5 to 15 seconds, before either the resting hand cools and becomes sluggish, or the working hand becomes tired.** If you choose the rest interval just right, you will find that the rested hand is eager to perform. Don't practice when the hand is tired, because that will lead to stress and bad habits. Those unfamiliar with HS practice will generally have a weaker LH. In that case, give the LH more work. In this scheme, you can practice hard 100% of the time, but you never practice with fatigued hands!

**It should be emphasized that HS practice is only for difficult passages that you cannot play.** If you can play the passage adequately HT, by all means, skip the HS part! The ultimate objective of this book is for you to be able to quickly play HT with practically no HS practice after you become proficient. The objective is not to cultivate a dependence on HS practice. Use HS only when necessary and try to reduce its use gradually as your technique advances.


### Continuity Rule

**When practicing one segment, always include the beginning of the following segment.** This continuity rule ensures that when you have learned two adjacent segments, you can also play them together. It applies to any segment you isolate for practice, such as a bar, an entire movement, or even to segments smaller than a bar. **A generalization of the continuity rule is that any passage may be broken up into short segments for practice, but these segments must overlap. The overlapping note or group of notes is called the conjunction.**


### Chord Attack

If you practice the quadruplet slowly and gradually speed it up HS, you will hit a "speed wall", a speed beyond which everything breaks down and stress builds up. **The way to break this speed wall is to play the quadruplet as a single chord (CEG). You have gone from slow speed to infinite speed! This is called a chord attack.** Now you only have to learn to slow down, which is easier than speeding up because there is no speed wall when you are slowing down. The key is -- how do you slow down?

**First play the chord and bounce the hand up and down at the frequency at which the quadruplet will be repeated** (say, between one and two times a second); this teaches the hand, wrist, arms, shoulder, etc., what they need to do for fast repetitions, and to exercise the appropriate muscles. Note that the fingers are now positioned correctly for fast playing; they are resting comfortably on the keys and slightly curled. Slow down and speed up the bounce frequency (even beyond the required speed!), noting how to alter the wrist, arm, fingers, etc., positions and motions to maximize comfort and avoid fatigue. If you feel fatigue after a while, then you are either doing something wrong, or else you have not yet acquired the technique of bouncing the chords. You will need to practice it until you can do that without tiring because if you can't do it for a chord, you will never do it for quadruplets.

**The most basic way to learn how to play a difficult passage is to build it up two notes at a time, using the chord attack.** In our (LH) CGEG example, we start with the first two notes. A two-note chord attack (strictly speaking, an interval attack)! Play these two notes as a perfect interval, bouncing your hand and fingers (5 and 1) together up and down as you did previously with the CEG chord. In order to play these two notes rapidly one after the other, lower both fingers together, but keep the 1 finger slightly above the 5 so that the 5 lands first. It is just a rapid two-note rolling interval. Since you are bringing both fingers down at once and only delaying one slightly, you can play them as closely as you wish by decreasing the delay. This is how you slow down from infinite speed!

**A parallel set is a group of notes that can be played simultaneously with one hand. All parallel sets can be played infinitely fast. The delay between successive fingers is called the phase angle.**


### Learning, Memorizing, MP

**There is no faster way of memorizing than to memorize when you are first learning a piece and, for a difficult piece, there is no faster way of learning than memorizing it.** Start memorizing by learning how the music should sound: melody, rhythm, etc. Then use the sheet music to find and memorize each key on the piano for each note on the sheet music; this is called keyboard memory – you memorize how you play this piece on the piano, complete with the fingering, hand motions, etc.

Memorizing is a complex task (even after you can play the piece well); therefore, students who try to memorize after learning a piece will either give up or never memorize it completely. This is understandable; the effort required to memorize can quickly reach the point of diminishing returns if you can already play the piece.


### Practice Speed

**Get up to speed as quickly as possible.** Remember, we are still practicing HS. Playing so fast that you start to feel stress and make mistakes will not improve technique because you are just practicing mistakes and acquiring bad habits. Forcing the fingers to play the same way faster is not the way to increase speed. As demonstrated with parallel play, you need new ways that automatically increase speed and reduce stress. In fact, with parallel play, it is often easier to play fast than slowly. Devise hand positions and motions that automatically increase speed; this topic is one of the major contributions of this book, and will be treated topic by topic later on as it is too big to be covered here; it involves such specific skills such as thumb-over method, glissando motion, relaxation, flat finger positions, arm and wrist motions, etc., and the use of "post practice improvement". If you do not make significant progress in a few minutes, you are probably doing something wrong -- think of something new.

**Technique improves most rapidly when playing at a speed at which you can play accurately.** This is especially true when playing HT (please be patient -- I promise we will eventually get to HT practice). Since you have more control HS, you can get away with much faster play HS than HT without increasing stress or forming bad habits.


### PPI
Therefore, as you practice, try to gauge your progress so that you can quit and go to something else as soon as a point of diminishing returns is reached, usually in less than 10 minutes. **Like magic, your technique will keep improving by itself for at least several days after a good practice.** Therefore, _if you had done everything right_, then, when you sit at the piano the next day, you should discover that you can now play better. If this happens for just one day, the effect is not that big. However, the cumulative effect of this occurring over months or years can be huge.
