> We're made of carbon, oxygen, nitrogen, and so on. But most of the atoms in our body are hydrogen, just by number. Yes, if you count up the number of like the atoms in our body, most of them are hydrogen.
>
> And that means that they were formed in that two minutes, in that first two minutes of the universe. So most of the stuff that we're made of is actually big bang stuff. It's actually this primordial nucleosynthesis soup from the beginning of the universe.
