# How to Manage Multiple Interests

The basis of the video is prioritizing and realizing that we can only do so much at any given time.

If you have an interest but no time to include it in your life, there will likely be time to do it at some point. Prioritize in the moment.

If you have to do something, you might as well get good at it.
If something is part of your day everyday, it might as well be enjoyable.
