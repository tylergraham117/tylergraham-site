# clearly defined values


Clearly defining your values allows us to get one step closer to [[living our values]]. It's about finding what is truly important to you and what you believe in. 

The process of actually defining what you value can be difficult, and it changes over time. Our list of values is a living document. It's like our constitution. It's amended over time and grows as we do. It can be helpful to look outwards towards people we respect, but at the end of the day our values should be our own. 

A really great example of this is [[Benjamin Franklin's Thirteen Virtues]]. His values are formatted in list form, with a one word title of the virtue and a sentence or two of how that virtue is applied to his own life.
