# creativity is the processes of creating connections


Creativity is often thought of as creating something new. 

But there is nothing that is truly new. The bible says "There is nothing new under the sun" (Ecclesiastes 1:9), and I believe it. Really, [[nothing is original]].

So we must instead create unique connections between things that already exist, even if that connection has been made before. Things can be done more than once. It's a big world. 

Finding these connections is a process. In fact, it is the creative process. In his Masterclass, author [[Neil Gaiman]] said *"Ideas come from the confluence of two separate things. It's when you collide those things that creative ideas happen."* So the goal, then, is to create connections out of seemingly unrelated things. In a keynote titled Authenticity, artist [[Tom Sachs]] mentioned that *"Any two things are connected by a third. The difficult part is finding it."* If we can manage to find the connection between the seemingly unrelated ideas, then we have a new creative idea.

It may be a beneficial practice to make a habit of choosing two random things and trying to connect them in some meaningful way. Taking notes here in Obsidian is actually a really create way to practice creativity on an intellectual level.

A big part of being more creative is to [[pay attention to the world]]. Taking notes on things we experience helps too. 

Insights come at the intersections, or convergence, of seemingly unrelated ideas.

Creativity is simply identifying two things that seem unrelated and connecting them in a way that provides insight into how the world works.
