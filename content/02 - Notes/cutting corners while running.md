# Cutting Corners



One day while running around the neighborhood I noticed that each time I'd round a corner, I'd have this urge to cut through the middle to save myself from having to go all the way around. I'd never really given it much thought, but as soon as I noticed it I immediately felt wrong. The whole point of me being out there was to go running. There was no destination, no path I was meant to take. I was out for exercise, and I was cutting a corner on the path of my goal. 

When doing something, it's important to remember the reason why we're doing it. We should make things as simple and efficient as possible, but not so far that we compromise the goal.



An inquiry and exploration of the value of working and perfectionism and the "idea of done is better than perfect". Examining the point of what we're doing and adjusting the way we do it to best fit that goal. 
Long title and then aka "What's the point?"
