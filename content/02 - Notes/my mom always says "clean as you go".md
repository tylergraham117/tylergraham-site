# my mom always says "clean as you go"

### The Story
When I was a kid, my family loved to cook. My dad used to work as a chef, so he knew his way around a kitchen and liked to share that experience with us. Being used to a professional kitchen, my dad had a very assembly line way of cooking. He'd use lots of dishes so he could have everything prepared when he needed them. My mom, a great cook in her own right, had a different approach. She liked to minimize dish usage so there was less cleanup. Both of these methods are a different type of efficiency, and both have their place.
The best way I can describe these methods, and their differences, is by explaining how they make scrambled eggs. 

Dads method: Grab a bowl. Crack the eggs into the bowl. Whisk them up. Add a splash of milk, some salt and pepper, etc. Heat the pan, knob of butter, eggs in pan, cheese, occasional turn with spatula. Serve on plate. Dish Count: 6

Moms method: Crack the eggs directly into the pan. Whisk with a fork. Add the ingredients while cooking. Serve on plate, eat with the same fork. Dish count: 3

But scrambled eggs are simple. In making something more complex, more dishes are inevitable. However, this can be aided by a phrase that followed me throughout my entire childhood: "Clean as you go." Once you develop a habit of this, it becomes engrained into your cooking style. As something is cooking, you're able to save time doing something. 

My dad's method was to cook something else in this time. My mom's was to start cleaning. 


### The Point
There are lots of different ways to be efficient. You can add things, or you can take things away. Either is fine, but it's important to do one of them rather than wasting time doing nothing. Direction and action.

Title: Clean As You Go

When I was younger and cooking some food with my family, my mom would always repeat the same phrase: "Clean as you go." The idea here was that by the end of cooking, we avoided an entire kitchen full of dishes and instead just had to finish up one or two more. 

This is a good practice to bring into other parts of life I think. As we bring things into our lives, we should also remove less useful things from them. This can go for clothes, equipment, photos on our phones, anything really.
