# we must be challenged to be engaged

- Washing the dishes isn't very engaging because it isn't challenging.
- 


Challenge one of the main components of achieving [[flow state]]. It is likely because, if we are not challenged, then our mind begins to wander. It allows us to think about other things, including presence itself, and [[acknowledging presence forces its conclusion]]. While [[mind wandering]] is a positive, and crucial part of a healthy mind, it is the antithesis to presence. 


[[Jacob Collier]] discussed this in an interview I heard as well. He explained that being on the edge of his creativity pushed him to discover more. This is why he decided to delve into the world of microtones, an area often untouched by modern, western musicians. 

The potential for meaning in a story comes from conflict or challenge. A good [[story must have conflict]], or it is just the reporting of events. This is because [[story is a character that wants something and overcomes conflict to get it]].

> "In order to be engaged, I must feel a sense of challenge. For me this means stripping things back, which breed curiosity and accountability through forced tangents of decision making, so that my story - passed on through words, images and film - might be told with a sense of artfulness, authenticity, and insight." [[The Backyard Adventurer (book)]]

There are thresholds to the amount of challenge, both at the high and low end.

> "Risk versus competence has come to be known as the paradigm of adventure. A sense of adventure, peak adventure, or misadventure - scaling up intensity and required skill, and therefore risk - are *felt*. Death is the limit of misadventure." [[The Backyard Adventurer (book)]]

Boredom is probably the limit at the other end of the spectrum. 

If what you're doing doesn't feel risky, and you feel fully competent, then it probably isn't very adventurous. We need a sense of risk, a sense of conflict, in the stories we live.
