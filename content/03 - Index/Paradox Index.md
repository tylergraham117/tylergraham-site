# Paradox Index
*This just can't be.*


A paradox is a self-contradicting statement or idea. *Life is riddled with paradox.*

We love the idea that everything is binary. It's either *this* or *that*. But it can't be that way. The world of paradox proves that to us. So then, as many experts seem find about their respective fields of interest, [[everything is a spectrum]].

### Categories of Paradox

##### Technology
Today's technology is at the same time the greatest technological marvel of human history and one of the most dangerous things we've ever created as a species.
- [[Technology Hermits]] hide from tech, as it has the potential to be very dangerous.

##### Goals
- The concept of a [[Goal Heirarchy]] outlines how we should think about our overall goals. The paradox in this is that we should be persistent with goals, but also give up on goals as soon as they are no longer serving us. The difference here is between high level and low level goals.

##### Paradox of Choice
[[paradox of choice]]

##### Paradox of Ambition and Happiness
[[expectations are the enemy of happiness]]

##### Paradox of Meditation
[[Paradox of Meditation]]

##### Pain and Pleasure
[[Pain can be pleasure]]

### Paradox Dump
- There seems to be a paradoxical relationship in many Western Civilizations' desire for progress, productivity, etc., and our desire for a slow life surrounded by the natural world.
- More intelligent people may be more prone to addiction because of their mentality of "this won't happen to me, I'll know before it gets too far" Anna Lembke + Rich Roll. There is a counterintuitive nature to disclosing faults and trust. When people tell us why they're flawed, we tend to trust them more. It seems like it would be the opposite, but authenticity breeds better relationships, and trust is built on the foundation of relational capital.
- French paradox: the mystery (at least to nutritionists) of a population that eats all sorts of supposedly lethal fatty foods, and washes them down with red wine, but which is nevertheless healthier, slimmer, and slightly longer-lived than we are.
- One of the bigger issues in the way we observe the world is that different disciplines and industries and subjects have become so isolated that we have a to relearn lessons over and over when they could easily carry over. 
	- This issue informs the way I think about paradox. Conceptually, it's everywhere. Practically, we have to break it down to fit what we're specifically observing. So, the way the book is written will fit that idea. It'll encompass many separate industries or categories of ideas, but it all fits within the same concept of self contradictory, yet true (paradoxical) statements.

### Book Ideas
- Discuss duality
- Being aware of these paradoxes helps open us up to the contradictory and dualistic nature of the world we inhabit.
