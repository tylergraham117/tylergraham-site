# a simple antidote to distraction in a busy world

[[we are helped by what is to use what is not]]

There are lots of videos out there on distraction and focus. I've even made one. 

This one is different. I want to take a philosophical, artful approach. Use the principles of the Tao. Show, don't tell. This could be a beautiful film.
