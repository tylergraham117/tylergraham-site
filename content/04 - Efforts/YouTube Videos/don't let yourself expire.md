# don't let yourself expire
*The point is that if you don't keep things up in life, they expire. Things don't last without maintenance and purposeful upkeep.*



*(Documentary interview setup)*
There I was. Just sitting there minding my own business. And then she just barged in and tried to ruin my life.

(*Wheel in a projector or tv and show it*)

*(Cut to the reenactment)*
JRNIE, casually: Hey did you know its been like 3 years since you ran that marathon?

TYLER: Nah that was like last year.

JRNIE: No, look.

*Long dolly zoom into my face full of dread. or something to show how unsettling that is*



That was an unsettling feeling. 


You know those middle aged guys that played one good game of varsity football and bring it up every time you see them?
They're just like stuck in the past for some reason.
That's something I've tried to actively avoid in my life. 
But here I was, playing out that tired old trope. 


Just to catch you up to speed
*Look to side cam*
and definitely not fuel my ego
*look back*
here's a quick run down.


This is my friend Alden. One day, him and I were talking, and one of us said:
"We should run a marathon."
and the other one said
"Yeah we totally should."

And the rest is history. 
Except it's not because there's still more to the story.

We decided we needed a date on the calendar or it would never happen. 
We arbitrarily picked one a few months away.

Now, this wasn't what you would call a *"real"* marathon. 
We plotted route that was 26.3 miles (that extra .1 was for bragging rights) and Jrnie was just going to drive us out and we'd run back.

We didn't really care about times. We mostly just wanted to see if we could finish.

So we show up on the day mostly untrained and entirely unprepared.
And then we did it. No credit to us. We tried to quit halfway through and Jrnie just said it was run or walk because we weren't getting a ride back.

So yay. Awesome. Goal accomplished. 

But, as with any accomplishment, time starts to pass. 
*(Maybe show this with conversations but put myself on the wrong edge of the frame to symbolize nobody cares. For the first one maybe put myself on the right edge and gradually move over?)*
At first it's "Oh I did this thing the other day." And then eventually you're not sore anymore and it's "Oh this thing I did a few weeks ago was so rewarding" and then it's "A couple months ago I did this bla bla bla" and time keeps passing and passing and *CUT OFF* 
**ENTROPY** **(gradualÂ decline into disorder.)**
*Entropy title grows behind me and then all of a sudden slams into the foreground.*

I find it interesting that lots of physics definitions also seem to have philosophical application. I can't decide if it's because of some grand design phenomenon or simply a bit of a stretch, but either way it feels useful as a lens on the world. 







I turned 25 recently, which means an underdeveloped prefrontal cortex is no longer an excuse. I'll have to find a new one.

Accomplishments have a statute of limitations.
Labels expire. An identity you adopt based on action only exists as long as you continue that action. 
If you stop being an athlete, you're not one anymore.
If you stop being a good friend, you're not one anymore.

What are some times I've let labels expire?
Relationships? We all get lazy in our relationships and friendships on occasion. What does this do to them? How do we stop that from happening?



It's easy to let friendships fade. We get busy and just assume the people that have been there will always be there. 





"It's just like riding a bike." That's the phrase right? "It's like riding a bike." 



is a common saying that refers to skills we generally don't forget how to do.

The thing is, we know how to ride a bike, but our specific bike degrades over time. Without consistent, proper maintenance, bikes get rusty and break.





If you're not moving forward, you're moving backward. 

The earth never stops spinning. If you don't keep up, it'll move on without you.
















Mystery Boxes:
- It's just like riding a bike
- We have to do maintenance on our lives.
- Labels expire
- If you don't actively maintain something, it fizzles out.
- If a label expires in your life, part of your identity dies.
- If you've been an athlete, but don't do that anymore, you're not an athlete.
- You are what you do, not what you used to do.
- Cognitive dissonance. Our self image wants to be congruent with reality. Sometimes our brain lies to us about reality to keep up our self image.
- "I am (blank)" What do you fill the blank with? Who do you tell yourself you are? Is it true?
- What characteristics do you want to have? And how can you reinforce those?
- We are designed to change over time. That change is shaped by our circumstances, but we can pick the direction. It's like a river, and who we want to be is the gravitational force pushing the flow downstream.
- Everything in life is in a constant state of decay and it is our jobs as human beings to fight that.

Any practical takeaways?
Maybe its that, for each identity label we assign ourselves, we can also assign an action step to be performed on a frequent basis. 
- Texting friends
- Exercising
