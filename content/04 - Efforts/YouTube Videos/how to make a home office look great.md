"The professional cannot live like that. He is on a mission. He will not tolerate disorder. He eliminates chaos from his world in order to banish it from his mind. He wants the carpet vacuumed and the threshold swept, so the Muse man enter and not soil her gown." - Steven Pressfield, The War of Art page 77

[[Cleaning connects you with your environment and workspace and allows you to meditate on a problem while occupying your body and mind with a task.]]

Keep your tools organized and your materials messy. (John T. Unger)

When in doubt, tidy up. (Brian Eno and Peter Schmidt)
