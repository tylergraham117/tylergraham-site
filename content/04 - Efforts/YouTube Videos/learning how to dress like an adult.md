#### Needs Filming
This might sound strange to some people, but for the first 20 something years of my life, I've thought clothes were kind of... (quick cuts) pointless.

Like don't get me wrong, I've had my phases of wearing different styles, but for the most part it's been the same my whole life. (photos of me wearing whatever)

Athletic shorts, t-shirt, running shoes. (jump cut wearing these things one at a time)

To be honest, I've always been kind of proud of that simplicity. 
And to be really honest, I tend to have this sense of moral superiority over it. Like I've been able to look past the advertising of these big fast fashion corporations and decide not to take part in the machine or whatever.

I tell myself lots of other smart sounding things too. Like that it reduces decision fatigue, or I'm saving lots of money and time not worrying about it.

That's the story I tell myself.

But here's the thing I'm starting to realize.

The story I tell myself and the story other people get when they meet me are two totally separate things. (Spin perspective change shot) *Maybe I can build a rig for this, and make a short form clip about it? Maybe I'll just use a 360 camera?*

Let me show you what I mean. 


#### Needs Filming

When I get dressed, here's how it goes. I walk in the closet and grab the first couple things I see. I put them on and I'm done. No choices have to be made, it takes a few seconds. Easy peasy.

That's where I've stopped for most of my life. And for me, this process feels great. 

But what's the other perspective? I mean, really, I don't even look at what I'm wearing all day. I'm looking outwards at the rest of the world. But to other people, I'm part of the rest of the world. 

What does how I present myself tell the people around me? What story do they tell themselves about me?

I mean maybe they're thinking "Wow I bet that guy saves so much time every morning getting dressed. I wonder what he does with all his extra free time?" or maybe "What a hero for not buying into fast fashion trends and being a conscious consumer."

But more likely its something else. Maybe it's that I'm lazy. Or that I don't pay attention to details. Maybe it's that I didn't care enough about us meeting up to dress up nicer. Maybe it's that I just don't know what I'm doing (that ones definitely true). 

That's not the impression I want to give. But I also don't want to compromise on the things I like about my current system of just sort of wearing the same thing every day. (show those signs from before, then throw them and look around or let it hang for a sec)


Check this out. I was on TikTok the other day. And I came across this guy. He was talking about fast fashion. He clearly knew his stuff. He was talking about the logistics of making a shirt for some ridiculously low price, and how it basically forces clothing manufacturers overseas to overwork and underpay their people because they need the money and can't say no to a big contract from these big companies. (show some brands)

I watched a bunch of his stuff. 

And it got me thinking. Maybe there's I way to keep my values, the ease and quickness and morals, but also dress in a way that doesn't make me feel out of place when Jrnie and I go out on a nice date, or when I'm in an important meeting, or just all the time. Here's the solution:

CAPSULE WARDROBE

Now I know this is nothing new. It's basically what I already do. But there seems to be a way to elevate it, to take it to the next level. 

Let me explain.

The whole point of this is to raise my level of confidence and sophistication in when I wear. 
And confidence is just a function of knowledge.


Right now, in the world of clothing, I'm pretty ignorant. If I'm at a clothing store, I feel completely lost. It's not that I don't like things, it's more that I just have no opinion at all. 

It's almost like being in a place where you don't speak the local language. When people say things, it's not like you disagree. You're just like, confused. I need to learn the language of clothes.


### Filmed
Any time I try to learn something, it always just starts with an overwhelming amount of research. It's all out there. The knowledge, the history, the opinions. I just have to go find it.
(Timelapse of watching videos)

So I've been watching random mens style YouTubers for like (look at watch) a couple days now. I'm learning an overwhelming amount. 

From what I've gathered, we can break down most clothing into these (write title cards). **Color, fit, design, fabric, quality, seasonality, versatility, and cost**. They all overlap and intertwine. 

Right now it's summer in Texas. So it's hot. Like, hot. (cook an egg on the concrete maybe on a pan.) ((heat the pan first))

This obviously drives what I'm able to wear.
But I've always thought that means pants and long sleeve shirts are pretty much unusable for half the year. Apparently that's not how it works.

**Fabrics**
It sounds like fabrics like linen and cotton are pretty much made for this type of weather. They breathe really well and keep you cool enough to actually go outside without getting absolutely drenched in sweat.

Other fabrics are better for keeping you warm. It sounds like fabrics in general are a really complex topic that I may make a separate video about because its super interesting.

All fabrics can be broken down into two categories: Natural and synthetic.
Natural fibers are things like the ones I just mentioned, linen, cotton, seersucker, as well as wool, silk, cashmere, etc. They derived from plants or animals.

Synthetics are things like nylon, rayon, spandex, and polyester. These are oil derived fabrics. Yes, oil. They've got some benefits, mostly in the cost category, but some really big downfalls. They tend to be favored amongst the fast fashion brands. 

The biggest problems with this is that the products made with these fabrics tend to not to last very long. In many cases they're designed specifically to fall apart, shrink, lose color, and eventually be replaced by another one of the same thing. This creates a pretty consistent revenue stream thats great for business and terrible for everything else.

For what should be pretty obvious reasons by now, I'll be doing my best to stay away from this side of things and instead opt for natural fibers. It'll be a little more expensive, but I can offset that cost by just buying more versatile pieces.

**Versatility** refers to how you can wear something. Take for example some navy blue pants. Or as the fancy people call them, trousers. 
You can wear them with a buttoned shirt, or a sweater, or a suit jacket, or a regular jacket, or multiples of these. Just by combining things differently, you get varying levels of fancy, all based around the same 1 thing. 

Obviously, some things are better suited for different parts of the year. This is the **seasonality** part. 

It's not just the fabrics that play into this. It's also the color, which we'll get to in a sec, and the **design**. 



### Filmed
Lot's of designs fall into the trend category. They look awesome for a year or two, but then they start to feel dated. You look back at old photos and wonder "What was I thinking??"

The opposite of a trendy design is a timeless design. This is something you look back on and think "Oh hey I still wear that because it still looks good."

This is another way of offsetting the cost. The longer you're able to wear something, the lower your cost per usage becomes.

Another thing that plays into that is the **quality**. Some things are frankly just made like shit. 

They fall apart after a couple washes. On the other end is something well crafted. There are lots of factors here, like the **fabric,** but also the care that goes into making it. Is something hand made or machine made? What level of quality control does the company have? 

This is really important to me. I believe in buying the best quality I can reasonably afford. 
This is for 2 reasons. 
1. If I buy something high quality, it will last longer. Lots of times, I end up spending less in the long term because I don't have to replace things. 
2. Nicer things are just more enjoyable to use. This seems obvious, lots of people seem to be completely fine with the frustrations that come with using a poorly designed product day in and day out. Like if it's something you're gonna use once and forget about it, fine. But if this is a daily use sort of object, just get the nice one.

Okay rant over, lets go back to **color**. 

I've been scared of color for a long time. It seems really complicated. It has it's own theory and wheel and I just haven't wanted to mess up, hence the black. 

But I don't want to be scared by colors. 

So let figure this out.







### Filmed
*Montage*

Okay this actually isn't that bad.

"Color" can be broken down into two main categories. Neutrals and colors.

Neutrals can then be broken down further into warm and cool. 
Warm neutrals are things like tan, beige, ivory, or brown. 
Cool neutrals include grays, blacks, and whites. 

Blue is also sometimes considered a neutral, especially in mens style, just because its such a common color that pretty much matches everything. Think denim jeans or a navy suit.

Colors can be categorized in a bunch of different ways. 

Lot's of people find it helpful to come up with a general color palette and just stay within that.

Another color concept that seems useful is the idea of "earth tones." These are colors often found in nature. Things like blue, brown, green, etc. Earth already kind of nailed beautiful colors, so it if we just steal from that we should be safe.

There's a couple guidelines I found to help me out with colors.

You can either wear *no colors*. This is where everything is a neutral.
Or, you can add *one color*. This ends up being either a sort of accent to the neutrals, or its a monochrome situation.
Finally, you've got absolute *chaos*. Basically, just tons of different colors that fit together in their own color palette. 








### Filmed
Alright so now that I sort of have an understanding of this (hold up title cards), let's try to apply it.

I'm just going to start finding some brands that I like based on what I've learned.

The goals are timeless design so I won't hate it in 3 year, mostly neutral colors with a little bit of crazy sprinkled in there maybe, light and breathable fabrics because its summer and I don't want to die, as versatile as possible so I can get more wears out of each piece, a good balance between quality and cost, and a good fit OH I forgot about fit!

This is a cool one! I used to think either something fit or it didn't. Like remember goldilocks? I thought that's how it worked. 

But apparently things can be baggy or tight and still fit. 

Check this out. 
You've got your body measurements, and then you've got the garment measurements. 

There are certain ways that certain types of clothes are supposed to fit. 

But sometimes fit can be a design choice too. 
This is another area where you can mix things up. For example you can have pants that are a little baggier, and then have the shirt be a little tighter. It adds some contrast to what you're wearing and makes things more interesting. 

The best part about fit is that you can pick things that highlight the parts of your body you're more confident about, and sort of mask the other stuff. 

With me for example, I'm a pretty short dude. So when I'm picking out pants, I'm going to look for a higher rise instead of something that sits on my hips. It'll make my lengthen the legs a bit and make everything look a little more proportional.






### Filmed
Now speaking of fit, it seems like all these brands use different sizing metrics. Some of the companies are in Europe, some are US, and they all seem different. But they have sizing guides based on actual measurements, so I need to get those down.
(Measure)
Most of the stores in my area really don't have the type of things I'm looking for, so unfortunately I don't get to try things on until they come in the mail. I'm having to make sure everything has a good return policy just in case they don't fit. 


It seems like there's three levels of customization when it comes to sizing and fit. 

The one we're all most used to is "Ready To Wear," which is basically where the company has a stock of some set sizes, and then you can get things altered later if needed. And it is almost always needed.
You see these sizes are usually made with averages of people. But anytime we take an average of people, it tends not to apply to any specific individual. 
That's been key to remember. It can be frustration to try a bunch of stuff on and nothing fits, especially since how something fits is one of the biggest factors in how good it'll look. It doesn't matter how nice the suit jacket is, if it's way too big for your shoulders, you look like a 12 year old wearing their dad's suit. 

The next customization level is called "Made To Measure." This is where we, the customer, send our measurements into the brand, and they'll make the garment to fit that set of numbers. This is great, because it avoids having to alter things later.

The final level is fully tailored clothing. This usually involves some back and forth with a professional. They measure you (or go off of photos if it's online), make a test garment, you try it on, they make adjustments, and then you eventually receive your final piece. As you can imagine, this takes time.

As you increase your level of customization, you also increase the time it'll take to get whatever it is you're buying. But you can be assured that what you're buying is quality. 










#### Needs Filming
The whole point here is to put together a sort of capsule wardrobe. I want to be able to go in the closet without really thinking much, grab a couple things, and come out looking like I spent a lot of time planning my outfit. 

Ideally, I'd love it if I could walk into the closet blindfolded and come out not looking like an idiot.

So I'm just going to front load all that planning. I'm using this software called Milanote. I use it a lot to plan the visuals of videos for work, so I figured it'd be useful here, and it is. 

Every time I find something I like, I screenshot it, copy and paste the link, and put the price. That way I can see everything I'm considering buying at a sort of high level view. I can also move things around and visualize how it'll all look together.



Okay so after looking at actual products for a while, everything I've learned is starting to come together. I've been able to able to distill this mass of information into some cohesive guidelines for myself. 

I took loads of notes on everything I've learned and sort of organized it into a simple document. 

It includes the more specific info I had to cut from this video. Thing's like the different types of collars, different styles of trousers, and how they impact what you're wearing. It also includes the specific brands that I've found that seem to be really high quality. 

Originally this was just sort of a reference for myself.

Then I realized it might be helpful for other people too. So it's linked in the description. It's free. I hope it helps.

(Unbox shoes from front door, bring them to a pile of everything else I bought.)

So I got some new stuff. I'm really excited about it! They feel great and are like way nicer than any clothes I've ever bought for myself. 

This has been a really great learning experience for me. I feel like I actually have an opinion now, which is a huge improvement. 

But! There's always another layer. More to learn. A deeper level.

I mean I understand my reasons for all of this. But it can't be the same for everyone, right?

See you in the next one.

### Idea Dump
- 


---

## Premise

##### *Who is this about?*
- I dress pretty minimally. I don't really care about clothes. I wear basically the same thing everyday. Lots of other people do this too. It's easy. It feels like we're shortcutting the fashion industry, which lets us feel morally superior. We make this part of our identity.

##### *What do they want?*
- A system of dressing well that doesn't cost a fortune, is simple, and doesn't require constant maintenance. 


## Conflict

##### *Why can't they get what they want?*
- The fashion industry is filled with brands and people trying to get us to keep up with trends.
- Most companies sell junk that doesn't last. It wears down easy, leaving us having to buy again.
- Clothing seems pretty complicated when you've spent years avoiding it.

##### *What is surprising?*
- The answer isn't to wear the same thing every day. The answer is a capsule wardrobe. It give you simplicity, but it also lets you express yourself through appearance. 


## Stakes

##### *What happens if they don't get what they want?*
- You walk around uncomfortable in situations where clothing seems important. 
	- For example, if you typically dress pretty casually, being in a fancy restaurant can be leave you feeling insecure, especially if people around you seem to know what they're doing.
- You tell a story about yourself to others than might not be accurate or beneficial.
- On the other side of things, we can fall into the trap of fast fashion, constantly cycling through cheap, poorly suited pieces.


## Resolution

##### *How do they get what they want anyways?*
- By building a capsule wardrobe. It requires a bit of research and investment up front, but works out in the long run. 

##### *How does it end?*
- With a capsule wardrobe planned. We learn the value of appearances, how to put together different clothes, etc. Really, this is a journey of learning to care.


## Lesson

##### *What can be learned from this?*
- Everything matters.
- Our clothes tell a story about who we are.
- How to dress better


## Extra Questions
- 



# Metaphor


# Hook
##### *How does the video start?*
- For most of my life I've dressed about the same. I've tried a couple things here and there, but ultimately I fall back to the same basics. It's generally a t-shirt, athletic shorts, and tennis shoes. 
- I've dressed about the same way for my entire life. I had a few phases, but always tend to fall back into the same pattern of basics. Usually a t-shirt, athletic shorts, and tennis shoes. I tell myself lots of stories about why I do this. It's minimal and simple. I don't have to spend a lot of time thinking about what to wear. I'm not contributing to the fast fashion industry. Lot's of intellectual things that make me feel good about myself.

# Script

## Intro
I've dressed about the same way for my entire life. I had a few phases, but always tend to fall back into the same pattern of basics. Usually a t-shirt, athletic shorts, and tennis shoes. For nice occasions, I have a button down shirt and a few pairs of pants. For really nice occasions I've got a reasonably nice suit from a department store. Most of my clothes these days are black so everything matches.

I tell myself lots of stories about why I do this. It's minimal and simple. I don't have to spend a lot of time thinking about what to wear. I'm not contributing to the fast fashion industry. Everything matches, so I can't really mess up. Lot's of intellectual reasons that make me feel good about myself. 

But here's the thing. Let's say Jrnie and I are going out on a date. Or out to dinner with friends. What do I wear? We live in Texas, so a suit, especially a black suit, is usually out of the question. So lots of the time I end up in the same basics. And sometimes I end up feeling a little uncomfortable or insecure about not being dressed nice enough. I usually laugh it off or ignore it. 

But maybe there's a way I can keep the simplicity but actually dress appropriately. This is learning how to dress like an adult. 


## Why does it matter?
Alright so before we actually start researching, I want to establish why this even matters. I mean who cares right? It's just clothes.

I thought that way for a long time. 

But recently I've seen more people online talking about the importance of appearance. And not just people in like the fashion space, these are people I respect that have no ulterior motives that involve selling me clothes. 

I'm coming to realize that what we wear is the first bit of information that people get about us. What we wear tells a story about who we are. 

We might think we're avoiding it by not caring. But we're not. We may not be thinking about it, but to others, it might be saying that we don't care enough to put in the effort. They might perceive us as lazy or careless or lacking attention to detail.

This is absolutely not the impression I want to give. 

I appreciate the ease and simplicity of what I have now, but I'd like to figure out a way to sort of elevate that a bit, and make it more flexible for more formal situations. 

I think the first step is going to be raising my level of confidence when it comes to clothing. And confidence is just a function of knowledge so, research time. 

*Research*

Alright. So from what I've gathered, we can break things down into the following categories.

We've got color, fit, design, fabric, quality, seasonality, versatility, and cost. Here's a quick rundown of how I'm understanding each one. 


## Color
Let's start with color. Color is incredibly complicated on the surface and I've honestly always been scared of it, hence the all black all the time. But honestly, after a bit of research, it doesn't seem that bad. Here's how I'm interpreting it:

"Color" can be broken down into neutrals and colors.

Neutrals can then be broken down further into warm and cool. 
Warm neutrals are things like tan, beige, ivory, or brown. 
Cool neutrals include grays, blacks, and whites. 

Blue is also sometimes considered a neutral, especially in mens style, just because its such a common color that pretty much matches everything. Think denim or a navy suit.

Colors can be categorized in a bunch of different ways. You can create palettes based on complex color theory. 
- Monochrome is a popular one. This is where all the articles of clothing are the same base color, but have variations in shade.

Another color concept that seems useful is the idea of "earth tones." These are colors often found in nature. Things like blue, brown, green, etc. Earth already kind of nailed beautiful colors, so it seems like we should steal from that whenever possible.


With colors, I've found a couple basic rules to ensure things look good. 
You can either wear *no colors*. This is where everything is a neutral.
Or, you can add *one color*. This ends up being either a sort of accent to the neutrals, or its a monochrome situation.
Finally, you've got absolute *chaos*. Basically, just tons of different colors. This obviously works best when the colors are harmonious according to color theory.


## Fit
I've always thought of fit as something either fits or it doesn't. Apparently it's not that simple. 

There are two sides to fit. First, there's your measurements. This is the actual dimensions of your body. 

Then, there's how the garments actually fit over your body. Clothes can be baggy and loose, they can be fitted, or they can be tight.

Different fits can accentuate features you feel confident about, while masking things you may feel a little self conscious of.

For example, I've noticed I like the look of higher waisted pants on me. I'm a pretty short dude, so raising pants from the hips to the waist lengthens the legs, making everything look a little more proportionate.

Another useful tool is to mix baggy and fitted. If you're wearing a pretty baggy set of pants, then a more fitted shirt sort of ties things together. If you wear baggy pants and a baggy shirt, you might end up looking 12. Or I know I do at least.



## Design
Design gets into things like trends, fundamentals, and timeless pieces.

Trends, by definition, have an expiration date. My goals require a long term solution, so I'm going to try my best to avoid trendy things, and stick with more timeless options.

If you take a picture and put it in black and white, your clothing won't give away the decade you're living in. Dressing this way ensures that we won't have to continuously rotate out our clothes. We can spend money now, and wear the things we buy for a really long time. 

The goal is to find designs that will stand the test of time. We can do this by looking backwards. Styles that have been around for decades will probably stick around. 



## Fabric
Fabric is the main ingredient in a piece of clothing. Any product is a function of it's ingredient, so quality of fabric is a huge tell in the quality of the garment. 

There are loads of different types of fabrics. They can be separated into organics and synthetics.

Organic fabrics are things like wool, cotton, linen, silk. 
Synthetic fabrics are things like polyester, nylon, rayon, spandex.

This category is an absolute rabbit hole and will probably get it's own episode.

Here's a quick run down. 

Synthetic fabrics are oil based. They're usually cheaper, which is enticing for sure. But they pollute more, don't last as long, and usually don't feel as nice.

For me, I've decided to stick with mostly natural fabrics for any nice piece of clothing. I'm okay with a some synthetics with workout clothes, but I'm going to try and avoid it as much as I can.


In the natural fabric category, there are also varying levels of quality. 
The fabric something is made of will also determine if it'll trap heat or breathe a lot. This is huge for me. I live in Texas and overheat really easily, so I'll be looking for fabrics that let a lot of air through.



## Quality
Quality is more along the lines of the care that is put into crafting the piece. Lots of fast fashion brands seem to take the approach of just get it done as quick as possible. They're largely machine made. 

Higher quality brands are often hand made with care. 

Quality is going to make a big difference in not only how things look, but how accurate they are to the fit they advertise and how long they'll last. 


## Seasonality
This ones big. Living in a super hot area means that certain things are off limits for me about half the year. 

This is really important because if I'm going to spend money on something, I want to maximize how much I can use it. This means I'm not going to be buying lots of heavy fabrics. Instead, I'll opt for things that I can use year around.

Another big part of seasonality is understanding which types of clothing are best suited for certain seasons. 


## Versatility
This is the ability to dress something up and down based on what else you wear. I'm still kind of getting the hang of this, but 


## Cost
Obviously cost is going to be a factor. For the longest time, I've thought it was crazy to spend tons of money on clothing. There are so many other better things I can put money towards.

Now, I'm sort of starting to realize the value in it. I also believe that it is much better to spend a little more on something of really high quality up front is pretty much always worth doing. The same seems to be true in this category. If I buy some higher end clothing, but it lasts for like a decade, the price per use ends up actually being cheaper in the long run, and I have a better thing.




This is a little too informational. I want to take people on a journey. What was I doing when I was trying to figure things out and make decisions?
- Trying to figure out my skin and eye tones
- Measuring for sizes
- 




How'd it go the first time around?
- No idea where to start. 
- Research. Maybe explain the tips as I research them? Timelapse, look up at camera for a sec and say what I learned, then back to it?
- Measurements
- Colors pallets
- Milanote for mood board and capsule creation
- Trying to find companies that don't suck
	- Ethical considerations of fashion businesses
	- What to look for in a company
- 









# New Script


*This video needs to be pretty dynamic*


This might sound strange to some people, but for the first 20 something years of my life, I've thought clothes were kind of... (quick cuts) pointless.

Like don't get me wrong, I've had my phases of wearing different styles, but for the most part it's been the same my whole life. (photos of me wearing whatever)

Athletic shorts, t-shirt, running shoes. (jump cut wearing these things one at a time)

To be honest, I've always been kind of proud of that simplicity. 
And to be really honest, I tend to have this sense of moral superiority over it. Like I've been able to look past the advertising of these big fast fashion corporations and decide not to take part in the machine or whatever.
*show signs of what I like and am proud of regarding how I dress*
I tell myself lots of other smart sounding things too. Like that it reduces decision fatigue, or I'm saving lots of money and time not worrying about it.

That's the story I tell myself.

But here's the thing I'm starting to realize.

The story I tell myself and the story other people get when they meet me are two totally separate things. (Spin perspective change shot) *Maybe I can build a rig for this, and make a short form clip about it? Maybe I'll just use a 360 camera?*

Let me show you what I mean. 

When I get dressed, here's how it goes. I walk in the closet and grab the first couple things I see. I put them on and I'm done. No choices have to be made, it takes a few seconds. Easy peasy.

That's where I've stopped for most of my life. And for me, this process feels great. 

But what's the other perspective? I mean, really, I don't even look at what I'm wearing all day. I'm looking outwards at the rest of the world. But to other people, I'm part of the rest of the world. 

What does how I present myself tell the people around me? What story do they tell themselves about me?

I mean maybe they're thinking "Wow I bet that guy saves so much time every morning getting dressed. I wonder what he does with all his extra free time?" or maybe "What a hero for not buying into fast fashion trends and being a conscious consumer."

But more likely its something else. Maybe it's that I'm lazy. Or that I don't pay attention to details. Maybe it's that I didn't care enough about us meeting up to dress up nicer. Maybe it's that I just don't know what I'm doing (that ones definitely true). 

That's not the impression I want to give. But I also don't want to compromise on the things I like about my current system of just sort of wearing the same thing every day. (show those signs from before, then throw them and look around or let it hang for a sec)


Check this out. I was on TikTok the other day. And I came across this guy. He was talking about fast fashion. He clearly knew his stuff. He was talking about the logistics of making a shirt for some ridiculously low price, and how it basically forces clothing manufacturers overseas to overwork and underpay their people because they need the money and can't say no to a big contract from these big companies. (show some brands)

I watched a bunch of his stuff. 

And it got me thinking. Maybe there's I way to keep my values, the ease and quickness and morals, but also dress in a way that doesn't make me feel out of place when Jrnie and I go out on a nice date, or when I'm in an important meeting, or just all the time. Here's the solution:

CAPSULE WARDROBE

Now I know this is nothing new. It's basically what I already do. But there seems to be a way to elevate it, to take it to the next level. 

Let me explain.

The whole point of this is to raise my level of confidence and sophistication in when I wear. 
And confidence is just a function of knowledge.

Right now, in the world of clothing, I'm pretty ignorant. If I'm at a clothing store, I feel completely lost. It's not that I don't like things, it's more that I just have no opinion at all. 

It's almost like being in a place where you don't speak the local language. When people say things, it's not like you disagree. You're just like, confused. I need to learn the language of clothes.


Any time I try to learn something, it always just starts with an overwhelming amount of research. It's all out there. The knowledge, the history, the opinions. I just have to go find it.
(Timelapse of watching videos)

So I've been watching random mens style YouTubers for like (look at watch) a couple days now. I'm learning an overwhelming amount. 

From what I've gathered, we can break down most clothing into these (write title cards). **Color, fit, design, fabric, quality, seasonality, versatility, and cost**. They all overlap and intertwine. 

Right now it's summer in Texas. So it's hot. Like, hot. (cook an egg on the concrete maybe on a pan.) ((heat the pan first))

This obviously drives what I'm able to wear.
But I've always thought that means pants and long sleeve shirts are pretty much unusable for half the year. Apparently that's not how it works.

**Fabrics**
It sounds like fabrics like linen and cotton and seersucker are pretty much made for this type of weather. They breathe really well and keep you cool enough to actually go outside without getting absolutely drenched in sweat.

Other fabrics are better for keeping you warm. It sounds like fabrics in general are a really complex topic that I may make a separate video about because its super interesting.

All fabrics can be broken down into two categories: Natural and synthetic.
Natural fibers are things like the ones I just mentioned, linen, cotton, seersucker, as well as wool, silk, cashmere, etc. They derived from plants or animals.

Synthetics are things like nylon, rayon, spandex, and polyester. These are oil derived fabrics. Yes, oil. They've got some benefits, mostly in the cost category, but some really big downfalls. They tend to be favored amongst the fast fashion brands. 

The biggest problems with this is that the products made with these fabrics tend to not to last very long. In many cases they're designed specifically to fall apart, shrink, lose color, and eventually be replaced by another one of the same thing. This creates a pretty consistent revenue stream thats great for business and terrible for everything else.

For what should be pretty obvious reasons by now, I'll be doing my best to stay away from this side of things and instead opt for natural fibers. It'll be a little more expensive, but I can offset that cost by just buying more versatile pieces.

**Versatility** refers to how you can wear something. Take for example some navy blue pants. Or as the fancy people call them, trousers. 
You can wear them with a buttoned shirt, or a sweater, or a suit jacket, or a regular jacket, or multiples of these. Just by combining things differently, you get varying levels of fancy, all based around the same 1 thing. 

Obviously, some things are better suited for different parts of the year. This is the **seasonality** part. 

It's not just the fabrics that play into this. It's also the color, which we'll get to in a sec, and the **design**. 

Lot's of designs fall into the trend category. They look awesome for a year or two, but then they start to feel dated. You look back at old photos and wonder "What was I thinking??"

The opposite of a trendy design is a timeless design. This is something you look back on and think "Oh hey I still wear that because it still looks good."

This is another way of offsetting the cost. The longer you're able to wear something, the lower your cost per usage becomes.

Another thing that plays into that is the **quality**. Some things are frankly just made like shit. 

They fall apart after a couple washes. On the other end is something well crafted. There are lots of factors here, like the **fabric,** but also the care that goes into making it. Is something hand made or machine made? What level of quality control does the company have? 

This is really important to me. I believe in buying the best quality I can reasonably afford. 
This is for 2 reasons. 
1. If I buy something high quality, it will last longer. Lots of times, I end up spending less in the long term because I don't have to replace things. 
2. Nicer things are just more enjoyable to use. This seems obvious, lots of people seem to be completely fine with the frustrations that come with using a poorly designed product day in and day out. Like if it's something you're gonna use once and forget about it, fine. But if this is a daily use sort of object, just get the nice one.

Okay rant over, lets go back to **color**. 

I've been scared of color for a long time. It seems really complicated. It has it's own theory and wheel and I just haven't wanted to mess up, hence the black. 

But I don't want to be scared by colors. 

So let figure this out.

*Montage*

Okay this actually isn't that bad.

"Color" can be broken down into two main categories. Neutrals and colors.

Neutrals can then be broken down further into warm and cool. 
Warm neutrals are things like tan, beige, ivory, or brown. 
Cool neutrals include grays, blacks, and whites. 

Blue is also sometimes considered a neutral, especially in mens style, just because its such a common color that pretty much matches everything. Think denim jeans or a navy suit.

Colors can be categorized in a bunch of different ways. 

Lot's of people find it helpful to come up with a general color palette and just stay within that.

Another color concept that seems useful is the idea of "earth tones." These are colors often found in nature. Things like blue, brown, green, etc. Earth already kind of nailed beautiful colors, so it if we just steal from that we should be safe.

There's a couple guidelines I found to help me out with colors.

You can either wear *no colors*. This is where everything is a neutral.
Or, you can add *one color*. This ends up being either a sort of accent to the neutrals, or its a monochrome situation.
Finally, you've got absolute *chaos*. Basically, just tons of different colors that fit together in their own color palette. 



Alright so now that I sort of have an understanding of this (hold up title cards), let's try to apply it.

I'm just going to start finding some brands that I like based on what I've learned.

The goals are timeless design so I won't hate it in 3 year, mostly neutral colors with a little bit of crazy sprinkled in there maybe, light and breathable fabrics because its summer and I don't want to die, as versatile as possible so I can get more wears out of each piece, a good balance between quality and cost, and a good fit OH I forgot about fit!

This is a cool one! I used to think either something fit or it didn't. Like remember goldilocks? I thought that's how it worked. 

But apparently things can be baggy or tight and still fit. 

Check this out. 
You've got your body measurements, and then you've got the garment measurements. 

There are certain ways that certain types of clothes are supposed to fit. 

But sometimes fit can be a design choice too. 
This is another area where you can mix things up. For example you can have pants that are a little baggier, and then have the shirt be a little tighter. It adds some contrast to what you're wearing and makes things more interesting. 

The best part about fit is that you can pick things that highlight the parts of your body you're more confident about, and sort of mask the other stuff. 

With me for example, I'm a pretty short dude. So when I'm picking out pants, I'm going to look for a higher rise instead of something that sits on my hips. It'll make my lengthen the legs a bit and make everything look a little more proportional.


Back to it.


The whole point here is to put together a sort of capsule wardrobe. I want to be able to go in the closet without really thinking much, grab a couple things, and come out looking like I spent a lot of time planning my outfit. 

Ideally, I'd love it if I could walk into the closet blindfolded and come out not looking like an idiot.

So I'm just going to front load all that planning. I'm using this software called Milanote. I use it a lot to plan the visuals of videos for work, so I figured it'd be useful here, and it is. 

Every time I find something I like, I screenshot it, copy and paste the link, and put the price. That way I can see everything I'm considering buying at a sort of high level view. I can also move things around and visualize how it'll all look together.



Okay so after looking at actual products for a while, everything I've learned is starting to come together. I've been able to able to distill this mass of information into some cohesive guidelines for myself. 
Another difficult part was finding companies that make nice stuff. 

I compiled all of that, the guidelines and all the brands, into a nice organized list for myself. Then I realized it might be helpful for other people too. So it's linked in the description. It's free. I hope it helps.


(Unbox shoes from front door, bring them to a pile of everything else I bought.)

So I got some new stuff. I'm really excited about it! They feel great and are like way nicer than any clothes I've ever bought for myself. 

This has been a really great learning experience for me. I feel like I actually have an opinion now, which is a huge improvement. 

But! There's always another layer. More to learn. A deeper level.

I mean I understand my reasons for all of this. But it can't be the same for everyone, right?

See you in the next one.
