# why do people make youtube videos



people that make YouTube videos are doing some of the most important work of our time
thats a big claim. the essence is good though
why does youtube matter?




As far as I can tell, community is one of the great drivers of humanity.
We're all searching for our tribe.

This is a video about the importance of the work of people who share their thoughts, values, and experiences online.
But before we can get into all of that, I need to provide some context.


The story begins back before YouTube, before the internet, before agriculture.
Back when humans were hunter-gatherers. 

I know this feels like a bait and switch to talk about anthropology but just bear with me it'll make sense in a second.

About 3 million years ago, our ancestors develop the ability to hunt by throwing stuff. Mostly rocks.

This is a really big deal. When you're hunting something like a lion in the African savannah, hunting from a distance means that everyone gets to survive. 

But it requires coordination. Everyone in the hunting party has to communicate and throw their rock at the same time. 

And this is the first time that group dynamics became especially valuable to our ancestors. Its a huge incentive to work together as a group. (scrapbook style: our first group project)

Later, as the human race develops, this sort of cooperation bleeds into other areas of life. We start dividing labor, we take turns watching for wolves, we pool food together none of us starve, and we share parenting responsibilities. By cooperating and communicating we make it possible to plan for the future for the first time.

Our ability to exchange ideas and share information is what allows the human species to survive.

Out of all the animals on the planet, we are the only one that shares what we're thinking about with others even when there's no apparent reason to.

By sharing our thoughts and feelings, we're able to better understand each other, which makes long term cooperation easier. 

In the beginning, our socializing was mostly just for survival purposes. It was pragmatic.

So we evolve to seek an emotional consensus with those around us. We have to get on the same page if we're going to try and survive together.

And at the same time, we evolve an aversion to being alone. This is what drives us back into our communities if we get separated for some reason. 

And that aversion to being alone is the foundation of what we experience as loneliness today. 

In our ancestral world, at the first sign of isolation, our sympathetic nervous system kicks in. That's the fight or flight system. The pupils dilate, airways expand, and our heart rate speeds up. Blood pressure and blood sugar levels raise so that we have energy at the ready. In a very real way, our body registers isolation, and even the threat of isolation, as an emergency.

The whole body is engaged in this state of self preservation. We narrow our attention to the signals that are immediately relevant to our survival, and ignore everything else. 

More specifically, we ignore our more leisurely thoughts, such as desire, wonder, or reflection. 

This physiological response to isolation produces the anxiety that we associate with loneliness today. 

And in aid of all of this is story. 
Even when nobody else is around, story provides us with a sense of connectedness and belonging. It eases the hyper vigilant survival response. 

Story is how we share our thoughts.

We encode our experiences in story to pass them along, whether that be through words, cave paintings, music, or, in a modern world, YouTube videos. I told you we'd come back to it.


Stories encoded in art is how we understand one another at a deeper level. They gives meaning to our struggles, they comfort us when we're afraid or going through something. Story brings us together.

And "together" is our default state. Or, at least, it's supposed to be.


For the past 20ish years, Dr. Matthew Lieberman has studied this idea. He uses fMRI to watch people's brain activity while performing different tasks. Talking, hugging, doing math, and even just sitting there, alone. 

He's found that social and nonsocial thinking are conducted in two separate networks within the brain. We switch back and forth between the two.

The nonsocial pathways are for things like doing taxes or solving complex problems.

But as soon as another person is involved, our mind shifts to social pathways.

Then when we go back to the logical problem we go back to the nonsocial pathways.

Here's the thing: as soon as we finish doing some nonsocial thinking, social thinking activates almost instantly.

We default to thinking through the lens of social interaction.

When nothing else is going on, we yearn for social connection. 

But there's not just one dimension to social yearning. There's three.

The first is intimate. Think romantic relationships. This is that feeling of deep connection we get when someone finally sees through the masks and personality defects that we project onto ourselves and into the world. It's a bond of trust and affection. Its a sleepover where you stay up way past your bedtime telling each other secrets in your blanket fort, except you don't have to go home in the morning because you already are. 

Then there's relational. It's a yearning for quality friendships and support. 

And finally, Collective yearning. This is the desire for a community of people who share your sense of purpose and interests. And this is the one I want to zoom in on.

It used to be that our yearning for Collective social interaction was satisfied by our tribe. We had a shared sense of purpose to not die and make sure we had dinner.

Then it was satisfied by our town, our community, our religious affiliation.

I may be alone in this, but it sort of feels like this Collective socialization has been increasingly diluted, or maybe polluted by noise, in our day to day lives, to the point of it not really fulfilling the needs we have. 

I know for myself, when I look beyond my close relationships, I don't really feel a sense of alignment with my community. Not in a deep way. 

Enter: the internet.

I think that as the world has evolved and diversified and spread, we've moved our Collective yearning online.

I think that's the venue where we organize our purpose based communities now.

And I think that we organize them around people who are open and vulnerable and share their beliefs and values and interests with their audience.

And I think *this* is the importance of the work of these sorts of people. Organizing community in a way that fulfills yearning for Collective social interaction.

Their work, their art, their stories, become a beacon that community is able organize around.

But there are thousands upon thousands of people that point a camera at themselves and talk. 
So what is it that leads us to establish community around certain people, but not others?

Let's look at this differently.

The brain processes the world through story. Our senses collect information that the brain uses to construct the reality we experience. Anything it can't collect through the senses, it kinda just makes up. 

The brain is a storytelling machine. 

And what is a story? 

At it's core, a story is about a character. And the character, just like anyone isn't perfect. 

They're flawed. They have a view of their reality that is distorted by the gaps that the brain fills when it writes the stories we live in. 

Am I still making sense? How about an example.

Take the Lion King. 

Simba is forced into his hero's journey when his father Mufasa is killed in the stampede. Because of his distorted version of reality, he blames himself.

He doesn't know that Scar was the one that was responsible. 

And this distortion of reality, with it's subsequent impact on his world view, is character defining. 

In the same way, the flaws and distortions in our realities define our character. 

Interestingly, the flaws a character has, the mistakes they make, are what help and audience empathize with the character.

The reason for this feels self explanatory. Flaws and mistakes are a foundational part of the human experience. 

We relate to characters that are flawed just like us. 

And *these* are the characters, or in the case of what we're talking about, the real life people, who we get behind. These are the people we organize our communities around. That we can stand behind and say "we, as a collective group, believe *this*".

It's the willingness to be real and human that creates this sense of collective community. 

The point of a story is to answer the question "Who is this person *really*?"

And our drive to connect with people is what leads us to seek out the answer to that question.

And so when people are vulnerable and share their flaws, its magnetizing.


Now, as with anything, there's another side of the coin. 

When someone's work so gracefully displays their personality, when they're willing to set aside the drive to seem perfect and just be the person that they are on the journey that they're on, it can make the audience *feel* like they *know* this person.

It can turn into a parasocial relationship. 

And I think this is mostly an issue when we are struggling to properly tend to the other types of social yearning. The Intimate and Relational ones.

When those are lacking, there's a danger of treating these stories as something they're not. Rather than trying to be a part of a Collective social interaction, we instead create an illusion of a reciprocal relationship. Our minds begin to think there's an intimacy or friendship where there isn't one. 

I've certainly made this mistake before.

It's important not to overemphasize the significance of online personas, or celebrities, or even fictional characters, in our lives. 

We have to remember that the relationships we have with these individuals are one sided. 

But the relationship that we have with their values, the ideas they seem to stand for, and the community that their vulnerability attracts? That's real. That's something we can hold onto, something we can organize around, and something that can ultimately benefit our lives. 



A couple of years ago, I connected with this group of guys on social media. 

We all had this lofty goal of riding our bikes across the United States. 

Now, the adventure fell through because of some logistical reasons, but I think the point still stands. 

We all connected because we had been in the audience of the YouTube channel Yes Theory. The whole premise of this channel is to get out of your comfort zone and embrace the fullest expression of life.

And so since we had been a part of a community that had congregated around these values, we already had a common language. 

Rather than starting from scratch with "what do you mean 'embrace discomfort'?" we got to continue a conversation that had been started with this incredible body of work. We already had all the context that usually takes a long winded conversation to convey.



So I guess the point I'm trying to make is that the value of this work is that it gives us a starting point. It gives us a direction. And then, as a community, whether it be in small groups trying to ride their bike across a country or in larger groups creating change for the betterment of society, we have the opportunity to pick up the ball and carry it the rest of the way. 














- There are 3 levels to our social yearning. Intimate, Relational, and Collective.
This falls under collective. It creates a network/community of people that share your sense of purpose and interests.
This is increasingly hard to find today, especially in developed areas. As we becomes more "successful," we tend to buy ourselves privacy. That's another word for social isolation. 

What makes a character?



Don't overstate the importance

Parasocial Relationships and the dangers

The danger of this is when we treat what could be a collective social interaction as something it's not. For example, if I look at this interaction as a relational or intimate interaction, now somethings wrong. It turns into a parasocial relationship. It's one sided. I know lots about this person, but they don't even know I exist. That can be incredibly dangerous.









- Human beings have survived as a species primarily because of our ability to connect in social groups. It's our ability to exchange ideas, coordinate goals, share information, and work together than makes us special.
- 52 million years ago, the first monkeys and apes connected in groups. They started hunting during the day, which meant they were more visible to predators. This was only possible because of the group coordination. There is strength in numbers.
- 3 million years ago, we developed the ability to hunt by throwing stuff. We coordinated and threw at the same time. 
- For early humans, the odds of being attacked or starving increase dramatically if you become separated from your people.
- "We're the only animal on the planet that goes out of its way to share the contents of our minds with others, even when there's no immediate gain." Dr. Bill von Hippel
	- Doing this allows us to understand each other better, which has long term advantages for cooperation.
	- Sharing our thoughts and feelings to better understand each other is an essential part of the human experience. It is what drives us towards a better society.
	- Crowd sourcing the solution to a problem allows progress to happen much quicker than it would with individuals.
- "We evolved to seek emotional consensus." Dr. Bill von Hippel.
	- This helps us answer the question: Can we count on each other?
- In the absence of others, stories make us feel connected and promote a sense of belonging. This is why storytelling plays such a big role in securing our values, purpose, and identity. Story bonds us emotionally.
- Art is how we encode our experiences in stories. Through words, pictures, music, and rituals. They get passed down through the generations. They help us understand who we are. They give meaning to our struggles, and they comfort us when we're afraid or going through something. Story brings us together.
- Our social evolution is deeply intertwined with our physical evolution.
- A sense of connection lowers the stress response in the body.
	- The feeling of togetherness is our default state.

How it changed.





I don't want to over state the importance of this type of work. It's meaningful and it's important, but it is not a replacement for genuine connections and relationships in your real life. That would be like buying a protein shake and assuming it can replace your entire diet. It can't. It's a supplement, and it can be a really helpful one, but it cannot be more than that.

What makes his channel, or any, special?
It's not about the niche they occupy or the individual videos they make. 
It's about the feeling they deliver.
People come to count on his work because he consistently delivers a feeling. It can be motivating or entertaining or nourishing or whatever. 
The vulnerability he displays and the 





- Salary conversation
	- I respect you and your work a lot, and would love the opportunity to grow under your leadership. That being said, the scales of negotiation tip towards you, leaving me to be a bit more open and flexible in terms of compensation. However, it's still a business, and I assume a pretty profitable one.
