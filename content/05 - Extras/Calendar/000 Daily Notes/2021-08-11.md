I worked quite a bit on the bookshleves. They are coming together, but there are some gaps. I am wondering if construction lumber like pine is a pretty bad way to make furniture due to the imperfections in its general straightness and measurements. Perhaps something like MDF or plywood would have been a better choice.

There are gaps emerging on the bookshelves and I am mostly unsure of how to solve that issue. I will try a couple things, but I may end up just changing the joints entirely. Screws allow for relatively large mistakes. Tenons do not.
