# @ Today

- Jrnie and I are going to go continue our date from last night by looking at some fancy houses while we drink coffee and talk.
- We still need to pack, and I am hoping to also set up my desk today if there is any time.
- I did not spend much time at my laptop and so I didnt have many notes I could write. 
- I got my new desk in
	- it is lovely and moves up and down. 
- Today, Jrnie and I looked at so many nice dream houses for the future. It was really nice spending time together.
