# @ Today

- Our flight on Delta got moved today from 12:10 to 10:30 AM, but really last minute to the point where we were entirely incapable of making the flight on time.
- On the plus side, we got another day at home.
	- I got to set up the rest of my new desk and chair office situation, which I have been excited about.
		- Speaking of, I am not too sure about the layout anymore. I am discovering issue.
			- The door is behind me, which makes me feel like someone will burst in at any moment.
			- The ceiling light is directly above me, which I typically can't stand.
