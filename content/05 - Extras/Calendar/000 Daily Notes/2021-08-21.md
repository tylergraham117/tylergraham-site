- I think the bullet point version of writing my notes is nice for quantity but perhaps not so much for quality. When doing the bullet point method I tend to write pretty much anything that comes to my head, which is useful for clearing my head but not so useful for referencing in the future and using what I write for anything later on. That being said, I don't know what will be useful in the future, so perhaps writing as much as I can is useful so long as I come back to it at some point. I guess the main thing is the ability to connect the writing to some other note, story, concept, etc.
- We just got back from out trip to Pennsylvania. We had a wonderful time on the entire trip. I will likely go back and put individual activities on the daily note within which they occurred.
- I would like to slowly transfer a huge knowledgebase of anything I've read into this note system. 
	- This includes all sorts of disciplines, even information from cook books.
- I may start an Instagram account called "anoteworthybook" where I discuss noteworthy books.  [Done]
	- I may use the noteworthy thing for everything, but that also runs the risk of pigeon-holing me into that for a while. I think it may be worth it for the synchronicity of it all. That's useful on the internet.
