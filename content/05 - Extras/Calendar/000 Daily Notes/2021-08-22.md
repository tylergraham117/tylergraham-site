# @ Today

- Jrnie and I took Nana to church this morning. It was a Methodist church. 
	- We initially wanting to go to SMU's church, but Nana took too long to get ready.
	- The church was less thought provoking than I had hoped. 
		- I didn't really learn much or think much. The general message was do nice things for people sometimes. 
		- The story they told was from the book of Acts, which I did not know existed.
	- Mitzvot - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitzvah
		- Traditional, literal meaning suggests this means something like commandments.
		- More modern context suggests the meaning more closely aligns with acts of generousity.
	- Eleēmosynēn 
		- Alms, mercy, etc.
	- Nana really enjoyed her time there. She likely doesn't recall any of the messaging, but I think the feeling of belonging or homeliness made her feel good, and that's what really matters in her stage of life. Or any for that matter.
