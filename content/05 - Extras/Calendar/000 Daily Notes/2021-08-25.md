- 09:13 Off on my first run in a good while. I have a feeling it'll be on the short side and still pretty exhausting. I want to make this more habitual, so it's important not to go too crazy with it. 
	- The run went well. I set out to do a mile and I did the mile, no walking. It's weird when you get behind or out of routine to start running again. Once you get back into it it's all good, but it takes time and consistency to get there again. I guess that's the other side of [[the first step is the hardest]] idea, getting started is the hardest part. 
- I finished up the Rich Roll episode with Courtney Dauwalter and she mentioned that one of the biggest things she's learned from running ultras is that people are selling themselves short. If we just committed ourselves to something with all of our effort, more time and more energy devoted to it, then we would no doubt be successful in anything we desire. Similar to [[The 40% Rule]] from Goggins.
- Broke down a bunch of boxes and decided they should be reused for fire starter rather than going into the trash.
- I ate a piece of popeyes chicken today and my body feels like its going to explode. That was a really bad health decision, something which I have been making a lot of recently. I have this weird tendency to cycle between phases of ultra healthy living and the opposite. It's like a pendulum effect. Maybe I need to take the habitual side of these things a bit more seriously.
