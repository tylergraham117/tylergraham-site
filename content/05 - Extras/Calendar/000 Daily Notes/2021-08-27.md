- Yesterday I taught Jrnie a bit about obsidian, and she seemed to really understand the potential of its usefulness rather quickly.
- I started reading Ask An Adventurer by Alastair Humphreys, which I think will be quite a nice read, helping me understand how to begin to make some money via writing online, making videos, and potentially get into speaking at some point if that's what I'd like to do.
- CGP Cortex [Atomic Notes](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/cortex/id1001591696?i=1000489347445)
	- Discussing [[atomic notes]], [[Zettelkasten]], etc.
	- Working with analog systems can be very useful when struggling in a digital one.
- I've gone through a bit of a confusing and taxing back and forth with my obsidian system today. 
	- I'm starting to wonder about the value of daily notes. 
		- Daily notes connections in my graphical view seem to detract from the value of the connections.
	- It seems that Obsidian will not be getting a dataview style table ability that I find easy enough to be worth using anytime soon, so I think I may need to do all of that work in a separate app unfortunately.
