- I just went for a nice run. This whole week has been about one mile runs, just two simple laps around the block in effort to bring myself back up to a decent baseline. It is really easy to fall off when it comes to running. It seems like a few days off spells disaster for my endurance, which honestly strikes me as fast when compared to some other runners I've heard talk about this. Maybe I haven't build my endurance on a strong enough foundation, so the overall endurance suffers more expediently.
