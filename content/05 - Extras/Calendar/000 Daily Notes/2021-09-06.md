- Yesterday, Jrnie had a pretty real conversation with me about how she thinks I'm scared of my ideas, but that I have a lot of good ones and I shouldn't continue to fear them.
	- She told me that I should just make something for someone, and to avoid trying to please everyone. 
		- Maybe this can just be for myself a while back.
	- We talked about various reasons why I haven't started. 
		- She told me to leave my camera out and set up. This will serve as a reminder and as a reduction of friction.
		- I thought about buying a scale to visualize my balance between input and output.
	- I think the largest factor in not starting is being scared that whatever I will create will fail to live up to my internal expectations of what I should be capable of given my overall experience. This is both a new and seasoned venture, which should be exciting but has proven to be mostly petrifying.

		- [[Goals]] are about understanding the goal and understanding cause and effect. You desire an effect (that's the goal) and so you need to do the action that is the cause to catalyze the occurrence of the effect. Consistency and time management and all these strategies are useful, but they aren't the actual cause.

		- We go around life assuming that our beliefs our mostly true, until we are confronted by something that shows us how wrong this is. By acknowledging this up front, we allow ourselves to become more curious about the world and it drive us to learn how the world actually works. 
			- [[If you're failing, it's either because you're not good enough or you just don't understand the world yet.]] 
		- Some percentage of everything anyone says is false pretense about the world. A percentage of scientific studies are false, so this is true of unproven things as well.
		- Delusion on a mass scale
		- Why do we have opinions on things we haven't verified.
		- Suffering derives from lack of understanding, power comes from gaining understanding.

		- Ambition is desire and attachment, which lead to suffering rather than happiness.

	- [i had a crisis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2o4eLa5cx4)
		- If we don't start questioning and inspecting our paradigms, we inhibit change from occurring, leading us to live a stable but unsatisfying life. 
		- Having a crisis forces one to reconsider the foundation on which they have built their life upon. 
			- [[we have to lose what exists to create something new]]
			- Fourth Turning Crisis leads to the next cycle starting.

		- "Give me a lever long enough and a place to stand and I will move the earth." Archimedes
			- What is leverage? It's a lever. Using a tool to get more from the amount of work applied to a situation.
