- I am quite worried about money at the moment, which is a terrible and debilitating feeling.
- Yesterday I set up a camera in front my my desk. I felt quite intimidated by it sitting there watching everything I am doing. Hopefully just by it just existing in front of me I am able to get a bit more used to having a camera stare at me. I'd like to feel comfortable in front of it by the time I finally work up the courage to shoot a video.
