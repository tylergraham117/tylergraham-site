- I went to the FFL office in Addison and learned a bit about how the phones work. More importantly, I got to feel the energy of the room, which was buzzing.
- Shot some drone footage for Jonathan Bustos in the evening for a barber shop. It was great to catch up. We talked about how he's been more isolated than before, but is working hard to improve and progress his life. This was relatable. He also wanted to talk about life insurance more. His fiance quits her job to go full time cheesecake maker in October, which they're both super excited for. He also might want life insurance for the loan aspect. He wants to buy land one day. They looked in the Celina area and even out closer to Paris. It was great to catch up with him. He seems like he's really trying to progress his life and take steps forward slowly and steadily, learning as much about the world as he can along the way.
