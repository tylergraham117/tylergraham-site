- Just started The 4-Hour Chef this morning. I'm really excited about reading it because it seems to be more of a framework for learning than a cookbook, which is far more valuable because I already have a decent grasp on culinary material.
	- I expected the book to be more about cooking things quickly, which I suppose it is in a way, but this is much better.
	- So far, the most interesting thing is the overall framework for learning. Tim's acronyms for this are [[DiSSS]] (deconstruct, select, sequence, stakes) and [[CaFE]] (condense, frequency, encoding).
