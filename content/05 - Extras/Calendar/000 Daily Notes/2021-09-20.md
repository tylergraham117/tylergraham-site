# [[2021-09-20]]

- Lately I've been pretty focused on myself, which is a good thing in a lot of ways but I think it comes with a certain neglectfulness of others that may not be useful. I tend to do this from time to time, so I'm not all that surprised by it, but at the moment I am much more easily frustrated by interruptions and pulls on my attention because I am wanting to use that attention for something already.
- We're going to look at houses today and I am extremely excited about it. I will finally have a space that is mine. I can do whatever I want with it. It'll be absolutely fantastic and freeing.
