- Today's been full of no show appointments and driving. In this time I've been listening to podcasts and music a lot. One of the podcasts was with Jesse Itzler, who consistent seems to inspire me regardless of how many times I hear his stories, even if it's a repeat. 
	- The most consistent things he speaks on that get me are his views of time and systems to optimize his life. 
		- I particularly like the simple way he plans his day the night before, his year the year before, etcetera. This allows us to simply follow the script and get things done. Obviously changes happen, but this largely allows us to guide our lives ahead of time. If we don't do something like this, and we just live on autopilot, then our lives are mostly out of our control.
