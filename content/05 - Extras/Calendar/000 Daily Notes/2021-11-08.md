For my birthday, I got to go hang with some llamas. We learned a lot about them and walked with them for a few hours.

Llamas apparently don't like to be pet. The reason is because llamas tongue's are very short, so when they are born, their mothers are entirely incapable of licking them to clean them. Most mammals are cleaned this way from birth, so petting something like a dog or cat will bring them comfort. 
Since llamas are not brought up this way, they instinctively back away from this sort of thing. 

This reminded me about something I've been learning when it comes to talking to people, and more specifically training or giving advice to them. Everyone comes from somewhere different. It's important to keep that in mind when we're talking to them. 

Sometimes we'll say something to someone and it'll be incredibly helpful for them, and then we tell the same thing to someone else and it's useless to them, or perhaps even harmful. 

Don't pet your llamas. Keep in mind who you're talking to.
