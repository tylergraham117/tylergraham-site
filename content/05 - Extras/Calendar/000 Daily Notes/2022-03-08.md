### Who are you becoming?

##### What will they say about you when you're gone?

Tyler was loving and adventurous. He aimed to get as much out of each day as he could, so that the gift of life was not wasted on him. He worked hard to cultivate meaningful relationships with the people he loved. He did everything in his power to better understand the world around him through as many lenses as possible.

##### A story from yesterday:
We ate dinner with my parents. My mom has been reading this book about prayer, and was telling me how it's supposed to help her in life. I wonder if she'll become more forgiving of Nana through this, or if that'll be an exception. Either way, I'm excited that she's working to improve herself. I think she'll be happier.
