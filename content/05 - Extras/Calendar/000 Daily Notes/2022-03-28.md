##### What will they say about you when you're gone?

Tyler was loving and adventurous. He aimed to get as much out of each day as he could, so that the gift of life was not wasted on him. He worked hard to cultivate meaningful relationships with the people he loved. He did everything in his power to better understand the world around him through as many lenses as possible.

##### I am grateful for:
The wonderful place I am living, it's really remarkable and I'm not sure if I've earned it.


##### A story from yesterday:
Jrnie and I had a date night. We ate ramen that took ages to make and then watched Jo Koy. We were pretty disappointed with the comedy unfortunately. We'd seen clips that were really funny, but in the actual special he had a tendency to repeat himself a lot and take too long to get to the punchline.
