##### I am grateful for:
My workshop, and the fact that it allows me to create without limitations.


##### A story from yesterday:

I spent a good deal of the day in the workshop. I'm building a new workbench that is more sturdy and able to actually hold the work that I do. We tend to outgrow our tools over time, and in this case, I'm able to just build myself some new ones.

Chris came over as well to play in the metal shop. It was fun to see him try different things than I would've tried. I noticed that when I build something, my biggest priority is utility. It would seem that's not a universally consistent theme. For example, Chris's biggest priority seems to be "coolness" or authenticity to tradition, or just making something with a specific technique. The utility doesn't really matter to him. I think that's wonderful. He's truly making these things for himself and his level of experience in the workshop doesn't limit him to thinking in certain ways.
