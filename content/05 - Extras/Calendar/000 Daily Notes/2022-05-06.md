##### A story from yesterday:
Got a new carpet cleaner. Listened to a bunch of Jacob Collier. Learned a little about chess. Edited for Sidney a bit. Really excited for what's to come with him. We're going to do something big. Jrnie said something last night about how the questions I was asking were boring. Not because I was doing anything, she just felt life was a little slow at the moment. I definitely get that, and have a similar issue when people expect me to talk about myself. I look for some highlights but sometimes I have trouble finding them.
