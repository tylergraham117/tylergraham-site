##### I am grateful for:
The meditation course I bought a while back. It is immensely helpful and I should be more disciplined about using it.


##### A story from yesterday:
I played each piano scale around the circle of fifths. Jrnie and I got sushi. I've been stressed about money, and each day seems to revolve around either spending or acquiring money, which seems to me like a road to lack of fulfillment. Perhaps that explains my recent laziness.

### Fleeting Notes

I think I need to use my Youtube channel as a creative outlet rather than a potential job. I'll just make things that I want to make and potentially share them with others.
