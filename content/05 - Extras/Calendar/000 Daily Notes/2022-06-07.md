##### I am grateful for:



##### A story from yesterday:
My family came over for dinner. I made fajitas and we all just sat around and talked for a bit. My dad seemed off. I'm worried if he doesn't do something fairly radical, his health will continue to decline more and more quickly. I'm also pretty sure that changes can only really come from him, so I'm not sure how to introduce anything behavioral. 
Everyone loved riding Jrnie's E-bike. They'd never seen one before and it was really fun watching ride it. 
It was great having them over here. I think the change in environment brought everyone more energy. Conversations seemed better and we all were excited to be with each other.
