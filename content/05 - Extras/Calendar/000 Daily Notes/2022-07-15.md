##### A story from yesterday:

I think a big problem I often face is the implementation of big life ideas into daily life. For example, if I try to live in line with the idea that problems are all created in the mind, I run into new problems with other people. Perhaps that is because my implementation is faulty, and I am placing the blame on others rather than facing what is within. This has been a struggle for a while, and I feel as if I'm maybe finally coming to terms with it?
