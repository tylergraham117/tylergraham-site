##### I am grateful for:



##### A story from yesterday:

Jrnie and I had a conversation about our relationship and how she's been feeling as if I'm less interested in it than before. I tried to explain how I've been feeling. It hasn't been anything in relation to us, but I have been feeling less interested in my life in general recently, which has bled into impacting her as well. I've been detached, longing for novelty or something meaningful. I think I've just felt a little lost, like I've had less agency than I should. It's a strange feeling, but I think the mere talking about it helped a lot. Lots to think about.
