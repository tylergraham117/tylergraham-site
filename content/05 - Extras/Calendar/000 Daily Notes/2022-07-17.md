##### A story from yesterday:

Matthew came into town and had dinner with us. We recapped the last several months, and just generally made conversation over dinner. Alden came back and we introduced the two. That was a fascinating meshing of personalities. We all went to get ice cream. Anya and Caleb were there, which was super awkward as Alden and Anya had talked for a bit a while back. Nothing came of it, but there was definitely awkwardness in the air. Eventually we came home and Alden went to bed. The three of us talked for a while longer about a handful of things. One that really struck me was Matthew's lost hope in the world. His way of seeing things seems very... extreme maybe? Hard to describe. I was at a loss for words of hope, especially because I'm not sure he was really looking for any. It's hard to send a message if someone doesn't want to receive it.
