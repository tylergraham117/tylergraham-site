##### A story from yesterday:
Jrnie and I got really inspired from our RH date and decided to redo the upstairs. With that came a big new plant, rearranging furniture, and a new painting, which we obviously decided to make. Something about painting, specifically in an abstract sort of way, is really nice. There's not a pressure to make it be anything, you just sort of let it be what it wants to be. It's more of guiding the materials than forcing them to be something specific I really enjoy the process.
