- Sam Kolder just made an insane video that I really want to analyze and understand some of the shots.
	- [What happened to Sam Kolder? - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecOkmTD7KhU&t=324s)
- I also watched this video from Digital Spaghetti with Life of Riza finally, and it was solid. Love the idea of "based on a true story" vlogs and creating your own cinematic world within your videos. After all, [[you make the world you live in]], so why wouldn't this be true of our video creations. Genius.

	- She plans so meticulously in pre.
	- Simple but strict rules to guide seasons of creation.
- New Shaffer video

	- Sponsored by a small company within his new hobby, river surfing.
	- Hyper specific example of bigger ideas.
- Trying to get my Obsidian back together for creating. I need to stop trying to make it be an everything app. It's a writing app. I use it for writing. Not task management or whatever other things I try to cram intro it. I don't have time to sit here and make everything perfectly organized. Just write.
- [[color for filmmaking]]
	- All of the videos I watched today really have a great sense of how to use color in a video to convey an emotion or move the story forward. I need to practice this.
- wondering if I should finish my video on vintage stuff. Probably, but idk if I want it to be the same. Maybe make it more personal and story driven rather than explainer? [[why is vintage stuff so popular?]]
	- why am I drawn to meticulousness? #note/developüçÉ
