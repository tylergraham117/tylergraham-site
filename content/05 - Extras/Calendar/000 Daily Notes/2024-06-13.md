- I've been learning about the universe recently. It started with a new podcast from [[John Green]] and [[Dr. Katie Mack]],, [[The Universe - The First Fraction of a Second (podcast)]]
	- In the first episode, Katie mentioned the fact that people often say we are all made of star stuff. Things like carbon and oxygen.
		- She then goes on to explain that most of those atoms were actually made in the big bang. So we're not just star stuff, we're big bang stuff.
		- Parts of who we are were quite literally present in the first couple minutes of the universe, and that's an insane fact to think about.
- In [[Where Good Ideas Come From (book)]], he's currently talking about [[the adjacent possible]].
	- It's this idea that defines all the directly achievable molecular reactions in the prebiotic world. 
		- Basically, all possible next steps, without looking at the big picture. Just what could happen next.
			- This feels like it could be a useful tool in our own lives. What can we do next, big picture aside? #note/question‚ùì 
- I'm realizing that a lot of my consumption for the past year or so has been pretty unconscious. Instead, I need to practice conscious consumption and take notes on the important stuff, so I'm actually improving rather than just pretending to learn.
