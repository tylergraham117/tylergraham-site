# Color (video)


I'd love to develop my own version of this. Colors to live and work with. A strict set of the best looking colors.



## White 
In Vietnam and other Eastern cultures, white is the color of death.
Western societies, white often represents purity or innocence.

## Green and Yellow
Olive drab is from the trees of New England ("the most beautiful trees in the world.") Designed by the military. Standard GI color in WW2. Beautiful and serves a function.

Yellow is a subdued, intermediate alert color.

### Yellow in the studio
- McDonalds yellow - Golden Acrylic C.P. Cadmium Yellow Medium Golden # 1130-6 SERIES 7

## Red
A little red sends a message. Too much red is tacky, invasive, or overbearing.
Red is used sparingly to convey information.

## Blue
Blue is the most difficult color to represent effectively.

## Purple
Purple is forbidden in the studio.


## Orange
Orange is only a native color. They don't have orange paint, but allow it naturally.


## Black
Black is the color of strength, depth, and speed. It's the expensive color.

"I've been 40 years discovering that the queen of all colors is BLACK." Pierre-Auguste Renoir

### Black in the studio
- Duct tape
- Gaffers tape 
- Electrical tape
- Benjamin Moore Impervex LATEX HIGH GLOSS METAL and WOOD ENAMEL BLACK 309. 80

## Sheet / Reflectivity
- Flat Finish 
	- Reflects 1-10%
- EGG SHELL
	- REFLECTS 10 - 25%
- SATIN
	- REFLECTS 25 - 40%
- GLOSS
	- REFLECTS 40-70%

Gloss and high gloss resist marks and clean easily.
Flat is hard to clean but hides uneven surfaces.
