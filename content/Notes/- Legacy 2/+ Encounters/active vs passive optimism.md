Passive is "things will get better and I have nothing to worry about"
 
Active is "things could be better and I can make them better through deliberate action"




However... You cant be active about everything. Further, you can't be worried about everything. 

We can be passive when there's someone else being active and doing a good job already.

It's best to be active in the areas that we naturally thrive.
