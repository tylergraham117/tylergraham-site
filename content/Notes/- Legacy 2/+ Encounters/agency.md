# agency


Agency is the ability to take action, but more importantly, to choose which action to take. It's the capacity to exert your will on the world.

To accept our [[agency is a decision]] we must all make.

Agency is a muscle. We must practice it frequently because [[we forget our agency when we don't exercise it]].
