# ambition is often driven by comparison




[[everyone has a different perspective on the world]]

We can learn from others [[diversity drives progress]]

[[uniqueness comes from our influences]]

We look at what other people have in their life and think "hey that looks nice I want that too." And then we work really hard to get that. I don't think that's necessarily a bad way to compare, so long as our expectations remain in check. ([[expectations are the enemy of happiness]])

The trouble starts when we look at others and envy their life over ours. We have to walk a really fine line here.
