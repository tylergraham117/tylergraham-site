# beginner's mind



Having a beginner's mind means that we hold the mindset of a beginner beyond the beginning stages of learning something. By doing so, we are able to keep our curiosity of the subject, while simultaneously holding our ego in check and actually learning better than if we let ourselves become comfortable within the topic. 

In Zen Buddhism, this is called [[shoshin]]. 


In his book "Beginner's Mind", Yo-Yo Ma goes through his history and how he became one of the world's greatest cellists, and how this concept was imperative to his improvement.

In [[The Art of Learning (book)]], Josh Waitzkin has a whole chapter on this.
