# cities follow a positive quarter-power law

[[Where Good Ideas Come From (book)]] pg10

Originally discovered by theoretical physicist Geoffrey West.

Within organisms, [[Kliebler's Law]] states that metabolism scales to mass to the negative quarter power.

However, when it comes to cities, there is a *positive* quarter power law. This means that a city 10x larger than another wasn't 10x more innovative. It's 17x more innovative.
There is a +1/4 exponential increase in the relation between city size and idea generation.

> "Great cities are not like town only larger." [[The Death and Life of Great American Cities (book)]]

There is mathematical proof that something about big cities make it's residents more innovative and creative.
