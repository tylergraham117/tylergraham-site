# complicated origins of HDTV

[[Where Good Ideas Come From (book)]] pg12

>The convoluted history of HDTV's origins could be the subject of an entire book, but the condensed version goes something like this: in the early 1980s the Japanese public broadcasting company Nik gave a series of demonstrations of a prototype high-definition television platform to members of the U.S. Congress and other government officials. This was at the height of American fears about Japan's economic ascendancy, a time when Sony televisions were already outselling venerable American brands like RCA and Zenith. The idea that the Japanese might introduce a higher-quality image to the U.S. market posed a threat both to American consumer electronics companies and, as then-senator Al Gore pointed out after watching the NHK demo, to the semiconductor companies that would make the chips for all those new television boxes. Within a matter of months, the Federal Communications Commission formally decided to investigate the possibility of improving the picture quality of broadcast and cable TV. All the forces were aligned for the next major step forward in the television medium. Ronald Reagan, always one to grasp the transformative possibilities of television, even called the development of a U.S. HDTV standard a matter of "national interest." 
>But what followed in the subsequent years was less of a Great Leap Forward and more of an endless, serpentine crawl. First, the FCC appointed a committee the Advisory Committee on Advanced Television Service (ACATS)— that solicited and reviewed twenty-three different proposals over the next year, eventually winnowing them down to six different systems, each using a unique scheme to convey higher-definition sound and image. Some were analog, others digital. Some were backward compatible with the current systems; others would require the consumer to upgrade to new equipment. For five years, the sponsor organizations enhanced and tested their various platforms, at a cost of hundreds of millions in research-and-development dollars. The whole process was supposed to come to a conclusion in 1993, when ACATS was scheduled to run a series of final tests and pick a winner, but the final tests turned out to be a preamble: the only thing the committee agreed on was that digital was preferable to analog, which reduced the field slightly. The remaining contenders all had enough flaws individually to keep the committee from anointing a new heir apparent, and so the ACATS group proposed that the remaining candidates collaborate on a single standard. This group called the Grand Alliance reached agreement on specifications for digital high-definition video and audio in 1995, which the FCC embraced the following year.
