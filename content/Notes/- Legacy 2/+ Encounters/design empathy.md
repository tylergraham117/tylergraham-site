# design empathy
*Design empathy is not an actual term people use, as far as I can tell. Plenty of articles refer to empathy in design, but not as an actual phrase.*

*Design Empathy* is the process of considering the needs and desires of other people who might encounter your design before you've gotten any actual feedback.

This instinct, or maybe it's a mental model of questions and methods of thinking, often comes through experience, over time, after getting feedback on other project and talking to people about what they like and don't like in other designs.

*There's probably a parallel in video.*

When we make something, whether it be a product or an artwork or anything else, it's both for self expression and for other people to experience.

The [[balance between self and others in art]] seems to be something lots of artists wrestle with. Should art be made with the audience in mind, or just for pure self expression?

The answer seems to be somewhere in the middle. Design empathy is a version of the latter. 

By [[considering the audience]] for our design be can make better things. People will be more receptive to what we make, excited even, because [[good design is inspirational]].

This type of work is a version of [[emotional labor]], also not usually in the presence of other people. Instead, we must imagine how people will interact with something within anyone present.
