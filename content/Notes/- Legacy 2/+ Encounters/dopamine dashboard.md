# dopamine dashboard

The idea here is to develop a dashboard of healthy ways to use dopamine. 
[[Dopamine Nation (book)]]




When you're feeling understimulated and reach for the phone, do one of these instead:

(Sort them by how much time they take)

Quick boosts (under 10 minutes)

Things that really light you up (but take a while)

Sides (things you can do at the same time as boring tasks but make it more stimulating)

Overstimulants (things that we should moderate and schedule intentionally)
