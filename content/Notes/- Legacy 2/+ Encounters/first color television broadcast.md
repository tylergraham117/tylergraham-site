# first color television broadcast

[[Where Good Ideas Come From (book)]] pg11

The first national broadcast of color tv was on January 1, 1954. NBC aired the Tournament of Roses parade in 22 cities across the country. 
- The New York Times called it a "veritable bevy of hues and depth."
- The Times said "To concentrate so much color information within the frame of a small screen would be difficult for even the most gifted artist doing a still painting. To do it with constantly moving pictures seemed pure wizardry."
