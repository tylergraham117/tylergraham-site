# hierarchical zoning

These types of [[zoning laws]] introduce a hierarchy of zones. Typically in this order:
1. Residential
2. Commercial 
3. Industrial 
Under this type of zoning, you're able to build in any zone at or below your designated zone. For example, residential can be built in any of the three, but industrial is limited to those industrial areas.

This is a more flexible method of zoning and is used in lots of the world. 

The more restrictive version of this is [[exclusionary zoning]].
