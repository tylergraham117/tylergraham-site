# make the unconscious conscious

[[The Art of Learning (book)]]

As we grow in any given topic, we begin to become less calculating, and rather operate by feel. This is our subconscious taking over. Conscious effort is then able to switch into looking for growth opportunities. The potential pitfall here is that the conscious mind, rather than continuing to improve, will simply go into energy saving mode and shut down, because [[we default to the path of least resistance]].

Intuition is not a good philosophy for learning. We should strive to be more precise in identifying what these subconscious things are. Intuition is much too abstract. Instead, we should aim to [[make the unconscious conscious]].


Avoid intuitive action. It's lazy and abstract. Make it precise and tangible, so that you can better communicate and grow. 

Learn to communicate the fundamentals of what you are good at. Learn to break things down into incremental steps.
