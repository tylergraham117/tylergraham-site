# mood follows action



This is a phrase from Rich Roll.

The general concept is this: 
Sometimes we don't feel like doing something we need/want to do. Actually, a lot of time we don't feel like it, especially if that something is for our own good or to improve our place in the world. What's the answer to not feeling like it? Do we succumb to the feeling?

No. That's the wrong answer. If we always listen to ourselves when we don't feel like it, we'll never get anywhere.

Mood follows action.

The correct answer is to start. Take a small step in the direction of what we don't feel like doing. Don't want to go for a run? Put on your shoes and step outside. 

When we do this, something interesting happens. We get over that first hurdle, and suddenly the rest of them don't seem so big. Suddenly, we start to feel like it. Mood follows action.

The countdown idea from Mel Robbins is great for this. You count, and you start. Once you start, it's easier to just keep going than stopping. Mood follows action.
