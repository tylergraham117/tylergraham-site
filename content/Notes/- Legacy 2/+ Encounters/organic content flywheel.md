# organic content flywheel


I've been describing the Hootly product as a "content machine" or 
"content engine," but maybe its more of a flywheel. 

A machine/engine implies a direct function. *Input* leads to *Output*.

A good paid marketing campaign is an engine. You put in *gas* (money), and you get *forward motion* (sales).

Content marketing is not that. You post content, and you don't get sales. So what do you get?

In organic content marketing, you post content. And then you post more content. You provide value to an audience. You cultivate a community of people. You build a brand. And over time, as you continue to show up, your work compounds. 

It's not an engine. *It's a flywheel.*

Every time you show up and add value to your audience, your brand messaging solidifies. You become known for something, and branding is just what people know you for.
