# origin of vintage

The word 'vintage' originally comes from the world of wine. 

In the world wine, vintage refers to a particular age or year of wine, and usually included the place of origin.

*Vintage = "wine age."*

And then in the 1960s it was adapted to the world of clothing, and was used in a really similar way. 
A vintage piece of clothing was roughly the same as a good year of grapes, and was probably worth buying.

But language is alive and the word soon morphed into a more abstract and general description of old clothing.
