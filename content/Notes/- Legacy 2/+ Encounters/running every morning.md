# running every morning


#### Intro
*(Various shots of people running in the morning. Quick cuts. Build a fast sequence.)*
You know *those* people?
You know the ones I'm talking about.

The ones that spring out of bed in the morning? 
The ones that skip making coffee because it slows them down.
The ones that are out the door before the sun is up.


I've always secretly wanted to be one of those people. 
Especially the variety that goes straight out for a run. 
It's a perfect blend of everything you need to have a good morning. 

And yet... 

You know those people who wake up in the morning like they couldn't wait for the alarm to go off? Then they lace up there shoes and right away they're out the door on their morning run. And they clock miles before most people are even awake. You know those people?

(MED: Push in on alarm clock. It reaches 6 or whatever time, and I snooze it and knock it over.)

That is not me.



#### Tired of Being Tired Intro
*(MED: Centered shot of me going through life. Snorri Cam. Match cuts on face.)*
For as long as I can remember I’ve had this low grade feeling of lethargy. 

*(WI: Tracking shot of me looking like a zombie walking to get coffee)*
I’m just a little bit tired all the time.

*(Varied shots of different habits, some good some bad.)*
But the actions we take impact how we feel. Some give us energy and others drain us. 

*(CU: Pull gaff tape, write mantra on it.)*
In other words, "Mood follows action." (-rich roll)

*(More varied shots of habits)*
So I’m on a path to explore different ways to get my baseline energy levels up to where they should be.

#### Day 1

Wake up

I didn't prepare anything for the run. I got up and found some socks and put on my shoes and got out the door.

My heart feels just its got plastic wrap around it.


#### Day 2
Honestly, I thought the actual runs would suck but after the fact I'd have lots of energy and feel great. That's how I've always felt about running. But I don't feel like that. This feels bad.

	- Maybe hone in on one or two specific techniques like Alex
- Community helps
- 10 pillars of endurance events 
	- (Planning Experience fitness Health Nutrition Hydration Sleep Muscle management Mindset/motivation Community)
- Tackling my worst habit, sugar before bed. (maybe explain how it goes back to my childhood. Tell the story of me getting dessert because I earned it. It's like my first introduction to reward systems.)
