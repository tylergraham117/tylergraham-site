# shokunin



"Shokunin is a Japanese concept that cannot be literally translated into English. But dictionaries define it as “artisan” or “craftsmanship”. It could also mean “mastery of one’s profession”. But shokunin is more than all of these translations. It also means that the workers must do their jobs for the general welfare of the society.

Japanese people believe that no job is shameful as long as they take great care in fulfilling their duties. This is why the spirit of shokunin can be seen in everyday life in Japan. Even the efficiency of train conductors, electricians and custodians can be attributed to it. But where else can we witness shokunin?

One of the greatest example of shokunin in Japan can be seen in sushi-making. Sushi is everywhere--from grocery stores to high class restaurants.  With sushi becoming so widespread, it is easy to think that it is easy to prepare. But high quality sushi cannot be made by anyone. Years of training are needed to master the art of sushi-making. Apprentices are usually chosen by a sushi chef to train and share their knowledge to. Information like  the different types of fish and the way to handle knives are passed on to the student."
