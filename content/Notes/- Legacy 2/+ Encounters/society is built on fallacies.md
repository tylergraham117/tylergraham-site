# society is built on fallacies


Society seems to be build of fallacies. It's all a big agreed upon lie. However, the lies we hold are useful. They allow us to interact and maintain peace and commerce and life in general.

> "Society is indeed a contract. … It is to be looked on with other reverence, because it is not a partnership in things subservient only to the gross animal existence of a temporary and perishable nature. It is a partnership in all science; a partnership in all art; a partnership in every virtue and in all perfection. **As the ends of such a partnership cannot be obtained in many generations, it becomes a partnership not only between those who are living, but between those who are living, those who are dead, and those who are to be born.** Each contract of each particular state is but a clause in the great primeval contract of eternal society, linking the lower with the higher natures, connecting the visible and invisible world, according to a fixed compact sanctioned by the inviolable oath which holds all physical and all moral natures, each in their appointed place." Edmund Burke, Reflections on the Revolution in France, Page 108
