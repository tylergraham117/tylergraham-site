# stories should stretch during times of change

 The [[brain's primary mission is control]]. Since change signals a lack of control, [[change equals danger]]. 

Danger sometimes means danger. It's something that could harm us. But our [[brain's are not adapted for the modern world]], so sometimes a danger signal just means novelty. And [[novelty slows down time]].

Life seems to slow down in the face of change. In storytelling, we should aim to match this by slowing the pace of the story. Practically, this can show up in many ways, but it's important to let the story breathe.
