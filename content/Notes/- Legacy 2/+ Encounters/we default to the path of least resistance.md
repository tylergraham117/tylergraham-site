# we default to the path of least resistance


We've evolved to try and save energy as much as possible. This makes sense. The more energy we expend, the more we have to eat. Back before the times of grocery stores and fast food, finding something to eat was kind of a big deal. It therefore made more sense to conserve as much energy as possible and take the path of least resistance.

That age is mostly over. In the developed world, we have access to plenty of food. But our brains haven't caught up with that yet, so we default to the path of least resistance. 

Is it bad that we do this?
I don't think it's as simple as good or bad. Good or bad is simple. Binaries are simple. But they're usually wrong, because [[everything is a spectrum]]. By simplifying it into a binary, we dilute it's meaning, and [[diluting something far enough makes it a different thing]]. There's a clear importance to the path of least resistance, and I think there's something to be said about [[living in tandem with our natural instincts]]. However, succumbing to our instincts in the modern world often leaves us short of our full potential. Sometimes, our subconscious is holding us back from what we're capable of, and we have to consciously override that instinct through tools like discipline and mental fortitude. 

The balance between these two ends can be tricky. How do we know when to work hard and when to listen to our body and take the path of least resistance? 

The answer is also, unfortunately, complicated. I think the simplest way to think about it is this:
Be clear on your goals. Ask why you're doing what you're doing. If the end result is based on an intentional choice to further your position in the world, then overcoming that mental hurdle and taking a more difficult path is worthwhile. If you're just doing something the hard way because you haven't thought it through, maybe take a step back and reconsider.

There's also something to be said here about doing hard things habitually to overcome our susceptibility to the path of least resistance. I think this is useful. It's similar to building a [[bias towards action]]. It assures us that, when situations get a little more difficult than usual, we won't fall back on our goals and give in to the evolutionary path of least resistance. Instead, we'll power through, do the harder thing, and get the reward in the end. Sometimes, we have to sacrifice feeling good in the short term for a much bigger impact in the long term.
