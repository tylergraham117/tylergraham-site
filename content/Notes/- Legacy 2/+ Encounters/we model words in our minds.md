# we model words in our minds


We start modeling words in our imaginations as soon as we start reading them. This means that the order of the words change the hallucination people create, therefore changing the meaning. This means words should be written chronologically most of the time. *The impact of a message is altered by it's order.*

This is mostly for written story, but specific details help the audience better engage with the story. In order to make a scene in the mind of the audience, at least 3 specific qualities of an object should be described. (ex: "dark blue carpet," "orange striped pencil")

If you want to explain something was terrible, describe it in a way that terrifies the audience. If it was delightful, don't say that, but describe it in a way that the audience feels it. It's a classic principle in every form of art: [[show don't tell]]

Certain words can make our brains recreate the senses in our minds. ("Brown sock," "cabbagey.")
