# we see a reflection of ourselves in everything we look at

We think of "seeing" as just detecting the visual world. But its more than that. We tie associations to objects. Within our mental model of the world are smaller mental models of specific concepts and objects. We pack these models with personal associations from our personal histories. *We don't just see the world, we see our past.* 

Each of these associations leave us with a feeling that fades just as quickly as they arise. They precede conscious thought, but in the end *all these feelings reduce to the impulse to either advance or withdraw* from whatever we're seeing.
