# when luxuries become commodified
***This idea needs work. More specifically it needs research to back it up. Is what I'm saying here really true?***


*What happens when luxuries become commodified?*

The part of society with higher socioeconomic status becomes increasingly accustom to the luxuries. These are often produced by the other half of society. 

The luxuries become less appreciated, devaluing the price. It's a race to the bottom. Now, lower classes of society are working harder than ever to produce more for less.

Worst of all, the resources these luxuries often take to produce are expansive, and commodifying these products/services is entirely unsustainable on almost any metric.


When commodities are the default, it becomes a race to the bottom. In a race to the bottom, nobody wins. Winning, as in getting to the bottom first, is a terrible option.


It seems to me that this is the main feature of a colonial, capitalistic society. A lucky few reap the rewards of the many. A society begins to exist not for it's citizens, but to extract value from them to give to the upper classes.

In the Western world, we are told that capitalism is beneficial. The free market is supposed to encourage competition. But the [[free market is not free]]. It would seem that our modern [[society is built on fallacies]]. 

You would think that this is at least good for the upper classes. In reality, it seems like these societies are riddled with problems. We fall into the trap of [[aspirational consumerism]], where we think buying more things will solve our problems. We begin to over consume.

Is this just an inevitability of human nature? 
We succumb to the [[paradox of value]], which makes no sense in any logic way, but yet here we are.
