# art is about noticing


Art is about noticing what other people do not. 

Since [[everyone has a different perspective on the world]], everyone notices different things. That means any art we make is unique to us. 

When making art, we all struggle with feeling of inadequacy and being unoriginal. But unless we specifically set out to copy someone, being original is our default state.

Any time we take something into our brains, we subconsciously force our biases and life experiences and values onto it. That's why [[conversation is playing toss with clay]]. On every catch, we mold the conversation with our perspective. 

And the same is true of everything we take in. When we encounter something in the world, we mold is with our unique perspective. 

But to get to that point, we have to actually encounter things. We have to [[pay attention to the world]] and actually notice what's going on around us. 

If [[creativity is the processes of creating connections]], we have to find things to connect. Experiences, values, facts, perspectives.
