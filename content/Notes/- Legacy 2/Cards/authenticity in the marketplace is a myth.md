# authenticity in the marketplace is a myth

In the marketplace, people do not actually want authenticity. They want to be understood and served, not to be the audience to whatever you feel like doing or whatever your life in thrusting on you. They don't care. They come for something. They came for your brand. And brand is, above all else, consistent. 

A [[personal brand]] is what people expect you to be like when you want in a room. If you are not that, they are confused and a little upset about it. You've broken their expectations.

A brand is a story. And we know that [[authenticity in the face of reality leads to good storytelling]]. But this has its limits. It needs to be authentic within the brand you've created. It needs to maintain the feeling that people get from your brand. Since [[storytelling is about withholding information]], we must withhold the parts that are not consistent with the brand story we tell our audience.
