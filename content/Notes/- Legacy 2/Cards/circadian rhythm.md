# circadian rhythm


### Blue Light is Not The Enemy
Blue light is not the enemy. In reality, our eyes need the full spectrum of light, and it is ideal to simply lower the intensity of light that we experience at night by about 10x. The intensity should be just above what is the minimum level of light we can comfortably see with.

### Tripartite Model
There are multiple components that come into play with sleep. Our light exposure, and timing of such, is crucial. So is our feeding schedule. We should perform self experimentation and really find what is best suited for our bodies.

Regarding feeding, we should also take into consideration the research relating to shortened feeding windows.
