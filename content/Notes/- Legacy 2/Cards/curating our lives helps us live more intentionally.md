# curating our lives helps us live more intentionally
> *The [[unexamined life is not worth living]]. - Socrates*


We take a lot of things for granted. One of the biggest is our physical environment. 

Sure, we decorate. We pick out some furniture and lay down a rug and maybe paint the walls. 

But I think, most of the time at least, we tend to settle for good enough when it comes to curating our living spaces. Then, as time passes as it tends to do, the little work we put in fades together, and we sort of just forget about it. We begin to [[accept our visual environment as inevitable]]. We stop exercising our [[agency]] over our environments. And [[we forget our agency when we don't exercise it]]. This leaves us with a sense of complacency in our spaces, often the spaces we spend the most time in.

And I think that is a mistake.

As human beings, [[we are a function of our environment]]. The world that surrounds us shapes our mood, our thoughts, and our actions. We are constantly being influenced through our senses, even if unconsciously, and our [[input controls output]]. The things we are able to do are a function of what we consume. 

By being a bit more meticulous in how we curate an environment, we create an environment more conducive to whatever that environment is for.

A messy office usually leads to bad, uninspired work. 

Unless it's [[messy on purpose]], but that's a whole other conversation. The point is intentionality. 

In addition to creating a more functional environment, we appreciate it more. Being in a room in which we've spent a lot of time energy fills us with a sense of pride and accomplishment for our hard work, as well as gratitude for our past self who put that work in. It makes our proud of ourselves, and gives us confidence in our attention to detail, because [[self confidence requires evidence]]. It's the idea that [[how you do anything is how you do everything]]. 

To create a space that we can be proud of requires something I'm calling [[design empathy]]. We have to be considerate of our future needs, as well as the needs of others who come into our space. We are more detailed in how we [[pay attention to the world]] when we have the needs of many in mind. 

Building the habit of curating our environments will lead to a consistency of intentionality. And it doesn't have to stop there. We can curate other parts of our lives.

In this old (old in Internet years, at least) video from Johnny Harris ([[How to Remember Your Life (video)]]), he explains process of curating the photos in his phone's album. A lot of the process is deleting photos that are less important. By doing so, he's able to better hold onto these memories. 

It's clear that [[we shouldn't try to remember everything]]. Just the things we've deemed important. And the only way to find which ones are the important ones is to reflect, because [[meaning is generally derived retrospectively]]. 

It's like the idea from the Tao Te Ching, ""[[we are helped by what is to use what is not]]".  By creating structure and processes, we give space for new experiences and future memories. 

In essence, [[we can curate memories]].

After all, according to Lisa Genova in her book [[Remember (book)]], [[we forget most of life]] anyways. It might as well be on purpose. Our memory is largely organized by the amount of attention we put into something, so it makes sense that curation leads to feelings of meaning and intention. We remember what we pay attention to. 

This is why deleting photos and curating our spaces is so helpful. It forces us to pay closer attention. And [[attention is the most valuable resource we have control over]]. It's our entire experience of the world. It's how we can create beautiful art and communicate with each other and generate incredible ideas. 

Our ability to pay selective attention is what makes us human. And it can start small.

Being intentional, examining, reflecting, curating, and paying attention to the details in our lives create a sense of meaning and purpose. And we could all use a little more of that.
