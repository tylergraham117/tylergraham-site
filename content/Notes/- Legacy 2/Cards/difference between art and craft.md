# difference between art and craft

What is the difference between art and craft?

A craft is reproducible. There are clear metrics by which to measure the success of a craft. You can practice a craft and become a better craftsman than other people because you deliver a better result. Craft is a honed skill with a desired goal. Craft is doing something well, consistently.

Art is less definable. It preserves emotion. It has a message. It begs for change. It evokes (or provokes) something in the audience. Art focuses on a message. It aims for striking originality.

The artist that thinks they're a craftsperson may find themselves discouraged by how their work is received. The craftsperson that thinks they're an artist may fail to deliver on their promise.

Both are vital. Both have their place. But I think it's worth being careful about judging one by the metrics of the other.
