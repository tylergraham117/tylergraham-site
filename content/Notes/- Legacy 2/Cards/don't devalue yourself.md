# don't devalue yourself

In a marketplace, everything has a value. But [[value is based on perception]].

If you do work for a reduced rate, or add on work for free, you're devaluing yourself.

It's either free (a gift) or it's paid (work). Not some weird middle ground. 

Discounts are okay on occasion, but there should be a clear reason, and it should be known to all parties involved.
