# everything is a waste of time unless you decide it isn't


We don't find meaning from external factors. Meaning is an internal feeling and state of being, and we must therefore come upon it from an intrinsic place. 

This is why [[adventure is both insignificant and greatly important]]. It helps us create a sense of purpose and joy from a seemingly insignificant set of experiences.

Nihilism says that *nothing matters*. I suppose this is the beginning of an antidote to that frame of thinking.
