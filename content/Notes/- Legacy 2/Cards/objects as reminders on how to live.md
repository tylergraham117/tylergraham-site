# objects as reminders on how to live

Objects can contain symbolic meaning to us. These are modern day [[talismans]], and they serve as reminders to live in a way that is conducive to our values. The importance of [[living our values]] is pretty obvious, but actually doing it is a different story. These objects help us course correct. They're sort of like bumpers on a bowling alley. 

Some of my favorite examples of this are:
- A picture of the first photo of Earth from the moon, as a reminder of how small we are in the grand scale, as well as how beautiful our home is. [[Robert Fulghum]]
- Cutting out one pocket because life is a mix of what you're holding onto and what you're letting go of. [[Bob Goff]]
- A mood ring to remind you to pay attention to your emotions and those around you. [[Bob Goff]]

There are definitely more that I'll add as I remember them.

> Talismans are "physical signs of relationships with people and places and experiences. They are symbols of connection and reconnection, union and reunion with what is sacred to us." [[From Beginning To End (book)]]

In ancient times, talismans were objects often seen to have magical properties. They were help for all kinds of different reasons. In modern times, this word has all but disappeared, but we carry on our own version of this practice.
