# our existence is nothing without context



Without context, our existence, or that which we create, is distilled and simplified, by necessity, to a point where most of its meaning is lost. This is why story is so important. It gives others a glimpse of our perspective, because [[everyone has a different perspective on the world]]. 

Since [[we don't notice our objective status]], simply existing in presence cannot provide us with a sense of meaning and purpose. 

Presence is an important state. It's what allows us to enjoy life as it is, to simply be. It also allows us to enter a [[flow state]] while working on something important to us. 

But we do not always live in the present. Instead, [[we are beings of conscious awareness]], and [[acknowledging presence forces its conclusion]]. People are in a constant search for meaning, and [[meaning is generally derived retrospectively]]. This means, by definition, we cannot find meaning in a present state. 

Every state of thinking - presence, past, and future - are all paramount to the human experience. The past and future provide context for the present to live within. They give us a story to live in, and [[humans are natural storytellers]]. 

Our entire experience of reality is a story. It's a story our mind creates in order to try and make sense of the world. Our [[brain's primary mission is control]], and we try to control the world by making a story out of our surroundings. But [[our reality is a hallucination]]. 

If we want to present ourselves or something we've created, we have to provide a plethora of context behind that thing. We have to give some background into the origin and process of the thing we're presenting. Without that, people don't really have a reason to care. There has to be growth, or in storytelling, character development. This is because [[art only matters with context]]. Nobody cares about most pieces of art until they know how it was made, by who, and why. Then it's important.

This idea of using story to give context to something is transferable to basically anything. For example, the [[story gives meaning to self help ideas]]. Without it, it's just someone telling you what to do, and [[we don't like being told what to do]].
