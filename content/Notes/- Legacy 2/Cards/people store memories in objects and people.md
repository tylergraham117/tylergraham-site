# people store memories in objects and people

We often need an object or other trigger to recall memories. People store memories in objects and people. It's why coming across an old trinket from a different period in life brings a bunch of old memories flooding back. Photos are especially powerful because they contain the visual imagery of the memory, but any object can do the same. When this is done with people, it is called [[transactive memory]]. Objects that hold our memories can be called [[talismans]], although this word has mostly disappeared from the modern lexicon.

>"My small farm is filled with storied objects that are totems for how I live," in [[The Backyard Adventurer (book)]].
