# Take the win

We all have a vision for what it means to live a perfect life, or what the perfect outcome for a scenario could be. 

But perfect is a mirage. The closer we get, we realize it doesn't actually exist. 

It can be easy to cling onto this idea. 

After all, this is literally how our minds process the world, because [[the brain is a prediction machine]].

We create predictions and stories about our perceived reality. And we get really attached to these predictions, because we have to take them as truth.

It's the only way we can function. 

If you're walking down the stairs, you trust that the next step is going to be there. You don't have to check each step for it's existence. Imagine how impossible life would be if our brains didn't make predictions for us to rely on.

The issue comes when we create a vision for the future and it begins to not pan out exactly how we predicted. 

The world is in a constant state of motion. The more complex our vision is, the less likely it is to be exactly how we thought it would be.

But we can get the direction right. And when we do, it's important to celebrate that.

It may not be perfect, but it's a step in the right direction. Take the win.
