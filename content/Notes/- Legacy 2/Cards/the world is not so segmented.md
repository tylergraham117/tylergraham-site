# The world is not so segmented.

Everything in the world *is* the world. Things are not as divided as they are made out seem. 

We try to divide the world by different factors, but these groupings don't exist.

> "It dawned on me that there's no such thing as cleanly divided states of social, economic, and environmental factors of our world. The fabric of the planet, I came to realize, is much like an old pink towel, made of a crude yet orderly state of dissonance taking form in every rock, carpet, grub, drug and shoelace. Everything is the environment." - [[The Backyard Adventurer (book)]] 


**This concept is explored deeply in "Why Fish Don't Exist"**
We try really hard to organize the chaos that is our world. But it can't all be put in neat little boxes like that.


[[Range]] also explores this. If we try to keep things segmented, we end up with [[parallel trenches]]. Rather than applying ideas from one field to another through a [[knowledge transfer]], we end up wasting resources learning the same lessons many times.
