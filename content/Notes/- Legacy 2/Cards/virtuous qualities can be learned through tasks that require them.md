# virtuous qualities can be learned through tasks that require them

Maybe this is really *we learn through doing*.



We can teach ourselves what we consider virtuous qualities by performing tasks that require those qualities.

Example: Endurance running makes you more patient. So if you're an impatient person, you can learn that skill through that activity.

Figure out what you want to learn and who you want to be and then try to do something that requires that characteristic.

The reason this works is because of [[cognitive dissonance]]. It is a useful tool on the path of [[living our values]] and become a more integrated person.
