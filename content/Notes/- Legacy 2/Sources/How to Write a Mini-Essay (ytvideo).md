# How to Write a Mini-Essay (ytvideo)

Mini essays should be written in a way that helps your towards a goal. 

His example: wants to be a better writer. 

I want to be better at writing and making videos. Maybe I can try and include more metaphors in my mini essays, because [[creativity is the processes of creating connections]].

## 4 Rules of Mini Essays
- Keep them about one idea.
	- Rather than linking things together within the essay, put your links at the end. 
	- Connections are great, but if you put the link in the content of the mini essay, then it's hard for it to live on it's own.
- Keep it short. Keep it all on one screen.
- Stay organized. 
- Note your references. Make sure you keep your sources in line. 


## Structure of a Mini Essay
### 3 Part Structure
The default option.
- Intro
	- Rules of the intro
		- Present the premise of the essay.
		- Be clear.
		- Generate some curiosity. [[four ways to create curiosity]
	- Intro options:
		- Idea speaks for itself 
			- Just state the concept in clear words.
			- This works if the idea is novel enough to be interesting.
		- Inspire emotion
			- Lead with a push for empathy in the audience. 
			- Try and force the imagination to feel something.
			- Go for drama.
			- Any emotion works.
		- Ask a question.
			- This works when it's a question that the reader may want the answer to.
		- Tell a story
			- Throw the reader into the middle of a story.
- Body:
	- Talk about the idea in a way you understand it.
	- Try to read it from the audience's perspective rather than the writer's.
		- We have all the context, but readers do not.
		- A simple trick for this is to look away, then look back and read the whole thing through.
- Conclusion
	- The goal is to get the audience to stop and think when they've finished.
	- The opposite of a strong conclusion is an ending that just fizzles out from the body.
	- Try and write something that really sticks with the reader.

### Story Notes
An alternative format.
- Ask yourself: What is the point I'm trying to get across.
	- Try to find a story that relates to it.
- The story note allows for the use of any story.
	- Personal stories
	- Childhood memories
	- Other people's stories
	- TV, movies, novels


### Hybrid
Another way is to use the Story note format as a hook, and then transition into a classic style to discuss it.
