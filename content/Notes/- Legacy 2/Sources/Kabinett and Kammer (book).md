# Kabinett and Kammer (book)
*Sean Scherer*


### Summary
This was an interesting eclectic collection of interior design projects.  It's a coffee table book, and also perhaps a reference book. 

I enjoyed the odd selection of items, leaning towards the vintage/antique. It seemed to present items in a maximalist way without coming across as cluttered or knick-knacky. 
Although it's not really my style, there were plenty of photos that gave me ideas. I particularly enjoyed how certain things were displayed and stored, and I enjoyed the thoughtful nature of how each item was curated.

#### Introduction:
- *"The artist is a collector of things imaginary or real. He accumulates things with the same enthusiasm that a little boy stuffs his pockets. The scrap heap and the museum are embraced with with equal curiosity. He takes snapshots, makes notes, and records impressions on tablecloths or newspapers, on backs of envelopes or matchbooks. Why one thing and not another is part of the mystery, but he is omnivorous."* Paul Rand

#### Chapter 1: 
- *"Styles come and go. Good design is a language, not a style."* Massimo Vignelli
- Mirrors are great for adding light and volume to a room. 
	- They're easy art.
	- They can lead your eye into an adjacent room or expand the scale of the current one.
- Grouping mirrors makes their impact more significant. (different shapes is fun too)

#### Chapter 2: 
- Color shouldn't be scary.
- Color invokes physical feelings just like temperature.

#### Chapter 3: 
- Using object in unexpected ways (a rug on the wall) can add a sense of fun and bring attention to things we typically wouldn't notice.
- Everyday objects can rise to art.
- Pairing objects of different eras can create a juxtaposition that delights.
