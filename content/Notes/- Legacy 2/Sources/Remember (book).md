## Part 1
#### Introduction:
- Imperfections in our memory are the factory setting.
- We forget most of what we experience today by tomorrow.
	- We don't remember most of our lives.
- *Our brains have evolved to remember what is meaningful and forget the rest.*
	- And the truth is, most of our lives are habitual, routine and inconsequential, and therefore not worth remembering.
- When we forget things we want to remember, it's often because we haven't supplied our brains with the inputs necessary to support memory creation and retrieval.

#### Chapter 1: Making Memories 101
- Memories are created in 4 basic steps:
	- Encoding (capture information)
	- Consolidation (link new information to previously unrelated neural activity)
	- Storage (maintenance through structural and chemical changes)
	- Retrieval (activation of connections, recollection)
- Therefore to remember something: Put information in your brain, weave the information together, store that via stable brain changes, and fetch the woven information when you want access to it.
- We often think of memory as existing in some memory bank. But *there is no memory bank.*
	- Long term memories don't reside in one particular section of the brain. 
	- Instead, it's stored through a pattern of neural activity that was stimulated when you first experienced it.
	- Therefore, *[[remembering something activates the same neurons as the initial experience]].*
- Memories physically exist through a neural network of associations.
- *We retrieve memories when part of the memory circuit is triggered, activating the rest.* So to remember something, we need only to stimulate part of the neural circuit, and the rest follows.

#### Chapter 2: Pay Attention
- Memory isn't recording a constant stream of information from your senses. 
- *You only capture and retain what you pay attention to.*
- Often, we'll remember only some aspects of what's happening and forget the rest.
- We don't pay attention to routine occurrences. *We're more likely to pay attention to, and therefore remember, things we find interesting, meaningful, new, surprising, significant, emotional, and consequential.*
	- We ignore and forget the rest.
- We often remember the gist of things, but in muddy detail.
	- "Paying attention requires conscious effort. Your default brain activity is not attentive. Your inattentive brain is zoned out, daydreaming, on autopilot, and full of constant background, repetitive thinking. You can't create a new memory in this state. If you want to remember something you have to turn you brain on, wake up, become consciously aware, and pay attention."
		- *Paying attention and memory creating require conscious effort.*
		- Active reflection is great because it requires us to set some sort of intention and consciously pay attention to our lives.
- "Because we remember what we pay attention to, we might want to be mindful about what we focus on. Optimists pay attention to positive experiences, and so these events are consolidated into memory. If you're depressed, you're less likely to consolidate happy events or pleasant experiences into memory because happiness doesn't jibe with your mood."
	- *Our experience of the world is reflective of the types of things we focus on.*
- *"You find what you look for."*
- 

#### Chapter 3: In The Moment
- Working memory refers to whatever is currently held in consciousness. 
	- Working memory only holds what you are paying attention to in the present moment.
	- This type of memory lives in a sort of holding space in the prefrontal cortex.
	- It's a place for sensory information to go.
	- You can feel the fleeting nature of working memory. It's the feeling of a thought slipping away when we try to remember too many things at the same time.
	- The visual working memory is often called your "visuospatial scratchpad" by psychologists. 
	- For auditory experiences, it's called your "phonological loop."
- We can only hold information in working memory for 15-30 seconds.
- *We can sustain the same piece of information in our working memory for longer by repeating it.* It's like hitting the refresh button.
- We can hold more information in our working memory through *chunking and visualization.*
- For our brains to consolidate something from working memory to longer term memory, we have to convince ourselves that it's important to remember. If not, we'll forget.

#### Chapter 4: Muscle Memory
- We have three basic types of long term memory: memory for information, for what happened, and for how to do things.
- When we think about remembering, we're often thinking about declarative memory. *Retrieval of declarative memory involves conscious recall.* You can feel the conscious effort.
- "Muscle memory" is not like this. We don't have to consciously recall anything.
- Instead, this type of memory is created through a precise, repeatable, automated pattern of movement. *The sequence of individual steps becomes connected into a single retrievable memory.*
- "Muscle memory" is stored in the basal ganglia., while semantic and episodic memory are consolidated in the hippocampus.
	- The cerebellum provides feedback to the sequence. This is how we make adjustments and improve the memory sequence.
- *Muscle memory is all about repetition of a sequence of movements.*


#### Chapter 5: Your Brain's Wikipedia
- The stuff you know is called semantic memory. It's knowledge you've learned, facts you know about your life and the world, the wikipedia of your brain.
- Memories for what happened (information attached to a place and time), are episodic memory.
- The Spacing Effect refers to rehearsing information that we want remember over time, rather than all at once. This repetition allows our hippocampus more time to fully consolidate what you're trying to learn.
- Applying meaning is crucial when trying to remember facts.
	- *Applied knowledge is much easier to remember than random facts.*
		- Maybe this is why teaching something helps us remember it? #note/question❓ 
- Things are more memorable when they are surprising, disgusting, bizarre, ugly, active, or impossible. This is helpful for creating chunks to remember.
	- Memory palace - Moonwalking with Einstein.
	- This method for memorization taps into the brains natural story-based way of processing information. Visual and spatial imagery are easier to remember than random facts or information.
- *Semantic Memory is like a muscle. The more you use it, the more you can remember.*

#### Chapter 6: What Happened
- Episodic memory is you remembering your own life.
	- It's tethered to place and time.
- Routine is forgotten.
- Flashbulb memories are vivid memories of highly unexpected events.
	- They involve big emotions like fear, rage, grief, joy, and love.
- *Your most meaningful episodic memories string together to create your autobiographical memory, or your life story.*
	- It would probably be good to manufacture some episodic memories in the direction of a life you want to live. How can we do that? #note/question❓ 
- The average age of the first episodic memory is 3. 
- Age 6 or 7 is usually when the thick fog of childhood amnesia lifts.
	- Everything after that is actually included in the autobiographical memory. Things before that are quite unconscious.
- Most episodic memories are clustered between 15-30. This is called the reminiscence bump. Many of life's firsts are packed into those years. We remember new things because we pay more attention to them. They're novel and our brain has to pay more attention to understand what's going on.
	- If we draw that idea out, it would make sense that intentionally continuing to add new experience to our lives beyond that would expand our autobiographical memory dramatically.
- **How to add more episodic memories:**
	- Get out of your routine. 
		- Travel, rearrange furniture, celebrate half birthdays, or celebrate anything important, eat at a new restaurant, rent a new car. *Boring days are the death of creating memories.*
	- Get off devices. Look up.
		- You can't remember what you don't notice, and you don't notice anything if you're distracted on your phone.
	- Feel it.
		- Emotional experience are remembered more vividly than neutral ones. Get in touch with your feelings.
	- Rehash it.
		- Repetition makes memories stronger. Reflect on what happened, and regularly reminisce to hold onto memories.
	- Keep a journal.
		- This helps you remember stuff in the future.
		- It also helps trigger recollection of things you've already forgotten for the day.
		- Just the act of writing things once helps us remember things more deeply.
	- Use social media.
		- Reviewing things you've posted in the past can act as a powerful cue for triggering recall. 
	- Life Log
		- Documenting your life helps us pay more attention.
		- The photos, videos, or whatever else also serve as great recall triggers to look back on.
