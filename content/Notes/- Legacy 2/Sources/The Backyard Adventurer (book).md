### Information Dump

[[I started exploring new ways of thinking, questioning what to do, why, when to do it, and really, Beau, what's the bloody point to all this questioning?]]

[[Near-misses come and go, so you harden up a little and learn as only fools and experts can.]]

[[You forget to drink when you're always wet, or looking at a vast desert of liquid.]]

[[Such a breakthrough in thinking is to acknowledge that I have a uniqueness born of influences.]]

[[You come to rely on gadgets and digital numbers like grease on lips and milk on cereal, and I don't like the feeling when the batteries die, as if you've lost part of your brain.]]
