### Living a better story.

I first came across this idea in [[Donald Miller]]'s book [[A Million Miles in a Thousand Years]]. 

The general premise is that we are the main character in our own stories. In the book, Miller draws a connection between movies and the stories of our live.

When he was experiencing his book Blue Like Jazz becoming a movie, he noticed the strange sensation he felt when the screenwriters were editing the script. Blue Like Jazz was a memoir, so by editing the story of that book, they were in essence changing his life story in retrospect. 

This experience gave Miller an insight. What if he started viewing life in this way? He tried it. He thought to himself, if I were a character in a movie, what would I do next? And then he would do that thing.

This idea led him down a rabbit hole of learning about the structure of story, and what makes a story compelling to an audience. He learned from Robert McKee's *Story: Substance, Structure, Style, and The Principles of Screenwriting* how to better understand this concept.

By following this thread, he began to life a better life. He felt more connected to people, happier, pushed to do more and better things, to grow. 

One of the bigger insights in this book for me is that a character in a story does not do something without an Inciting Incident. Characters have to be pushed to grow or to do something new and out of the ordinary. In life, we are much the same way. We don't grow unless we intentionally push ourselves to do so. If we refuse or simply don't try to do this, we will fall victim to whatever comes our way, aimlessly floating through life. [[If You Don't Prioritize Your Life, Someone Else Will]].
