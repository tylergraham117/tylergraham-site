### Chapters
- Introduction: Roger vs. Tiger
	- Dives into the upbringing of two prestigious athletes: Roger Federer and Tiger Woods. The dichotomy between these two sets up the rest of the book by pitting Tiger, someone who was raised on his sport and specialized young, against Roger, who was able to experiment with many sports. Both became successful, but the difference highlighted here is the overall longevity of Federer's success. He was also able to live a more stable life outside of the sport. This is anecdotal obviously, and we can't be certain there is causation here, but the story still serves as a great setup for all of the points he goes onto make later on.
