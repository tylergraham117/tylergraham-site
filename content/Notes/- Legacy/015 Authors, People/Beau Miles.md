# Beau Miles
Beau Miles is a Youtuber, author, and PhD. He is a brilliant storytelling and filmmaker. He is one of my bigger inspirations for desiring to start a YouTube channel. His book, [[The Backyard Adventurer (book)]], is full of insights on what adventure is, how to film movies revolving around the self, lots of helpful reflective and introspective ideas, and much more.
