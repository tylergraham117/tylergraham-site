### Ideals

- The more you do, the more courage it takes to not do everything all at once. But the more you can embody that courage, the greater the depth of the end result.
- Allow creative ideas to flow out without judgement. This is how we achieve new and exciting ideas. Later, we are able to cut things out.
- There is no right or wrong, only strong ideas and weak ideas.
- Your creative tools should allow the shortest possible path between ideation and creation. Make sure they don't prevent you from getting things out of your head as quickly as possible. 
- It's important to be on the edge of what you can understand. The best creative work comes when you don't really fully understand what you're doing while you make it.
- Less is only more when you know what more is. Then you're able to make a conscious decision to step back.
- Anything perfect is neither perfect nor moving.
