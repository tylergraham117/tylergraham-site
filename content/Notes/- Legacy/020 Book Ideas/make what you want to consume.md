Anytime we're in a creative rut, struggling for ideas, we can look around for inspiration. This is the [[importance of being aware of what you consume]]. When we know what we like, we, in essence know what you want to make. And since [[nothing is original]], we can simply take bits and pieces from the things that inspire use and create connections, because [[creativity is the processes of creating connections]].

Make what you'd like to consume. If you would want to, chances are other people would too.

When creating something with a narrative element, consider what would [[make a better story]].

We can find inspiration by critiquing inspiring work. We just need to find and fill the holes in the work that excites us.
