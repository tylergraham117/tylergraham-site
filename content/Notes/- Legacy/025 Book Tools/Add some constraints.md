### Context

> "Nothing is more paralyzing than the idea of limitless possibilities."

[[paradox of choice]]

It's easy to get stuck in paralysis by analysis. 
Limitless possibilities get us stuck.

> "The way to get over creative block is to simply place some constraints on yourself."

By adding constraints, we have something to hold onto while trying to come up with something creatively.

Give yourself rules and you'll naturally try to come up with something creative within them. 

You can't think outside the box without a box.

Self imposed restraints are helpful. Externally imposed restraints turn into excuses, but self imposed ones turn into creativity.


### What is this tool good for?

Overcoming creative blocks.


### How to use it?

Look at the problem you're having more broadly. 

Add some real constraints to that problem.

Use those constraints to overcome the problem.
