### What is story?


[[storytelling is about withholding information]]

### Van Neistat

If your story doesn't contain a surprise, it's just a report. (This is the conflict part.)

It’s okay to fudge the facts in a story if it helps preserve the humanity of the moment.

Save the surprise of the story until the end. Don’t lead with it, because then the rest of the story is boring.

Never interrupt a good storyteller.

Don’t let the facts get in the way of the truth.

Story is a model, a format, that helps us connect better to each other’s human experience. 

Storytellers are sensitive, emotional people. You cannot be a good storyteller without connecting with that side of humanity.

Show, don't tell. Humans are primarily visual communicators, especially at the subconscious level. Use this to tell stories. If you say something, you pass on words. If you show something, you pass on an experience. Allow your audience the joy of experiencing your story. Let them figure things out.

Start with the ending in mind. Just like a GPS, you have to know where you're going to start going in the first place.

Your story should be trying to answer a question.

There are two journeys to a story. The physical and the metaphysical. The story moves on both of these levels simultaneously. Keep these in mind, and really focus on the emotional part. The physical part is mostly the vehicle to help you deliver the metaphysical.

Characters need to be unique. What makes them special? What are their challenges? What do they need to overcome?

Tell your story the most effective way possible, regardless of length.

Show what the character wants very quickly. The audience should know who the character is and what they want within 30 seconds.

### Jesse Itzler
Everything is public speaking and everything is storytelling.
1. Always have an ice breaker. Bring energy and tell a story.
2. Tell people what you're going to be talking about
3. Deliver on your promises
4. Leave people with takeaways or value.

### Nathaniel Drew

Don't over-explain yourself. Imagine that you're talking to your smartest friend.

Keep in mind the different levels available. Include broad and detailed information about the setting. Set the stage, and show whats on it.

### Jesse Driftwood

In filmmaking, the camera is the audience. A closeup tells the audience that everything in frame is super important. You don't need closeups for everything. Know when and when not to use them. 

Close ups are good for showing important information, and for punctuating a shot.

The order of a sequence can alter the audience's perception.

Each shot should either instill or answer a question in the mind of the audience.

The 7 essential questions 
1. Who is it about? 
2. What did they want? 
3. Why can't they get it? 
4. What did they do about it? 
5. Why doesn't that work? 
6. What if they don't get what they want?
7. How does it end?



The key to a good story telling is not how to tell a good story, but how to avoid telling a bad story: 
1. Be prepared but not too prepared.
2. You don’t have to be funny, because you are not.
3. Name names. If you can't use someone's name, they have power over your story. Don’t let someone with no name determine your story for you.
4. It is not a therapy session, then your audience won't be able to. It is not the audience' job to give you closure. You don’t want your audience to feel sympathy for you, you want them to feel empathy. If they feel sorry for you, they are thinking about you and your well being and not your story. Make peace with your story before you get on that stage.
5. Start from the beginning and end at the end. You have to trust your audience that they will get the lesson that you want them to get, or they will get the lesson they want to get. Don't rob them of that by telling the moral of the story.
6. The details are boring. Trust your audience. You are sharing human experiences and they will connect to you so skip the boring details.
7. The audience is on your side, keep them there. Don't make a controversial statement unless you have to. Don't offend you audience. 
8. Most IMPORTANT key: Sometimes details are important. Sometimes morals are necessary. Sometimes you have to offend your audience to make them listen. I can't tell you what your story is, and I can't tell you how to tell it. The only way you can do is with practice, go find a mic, get in front of an audience and find your voice. Be the hero of your own story, be the protagonist of your own story.

If you can't find story in your life, it's not that you aren't living. It's that you aren't willing to give up part of your story to others. You're afraid of judgment. - Neil Gaiman Masterclass
