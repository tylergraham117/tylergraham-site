### Idea Dump:

Quicker beginning.

The main premise can be a week-long challenge of writing a story from my life every day. Maybe more like 2 weeks or a month even. Make it long enough to learn from it.


I've tried lots of different versions of this, but the current best one is homework for life. It's practical and easy to stick to. It requires quick reflection, and hones the lens looking for interesting things that happen within your life. 



A story is about a character with flaw, and changing over time. Is the flaw that I forget everything? Maybe it's that I'm trying too hard to hold on? Or maybe it's finding the balance of both?

I have this tendency to constantly be looking forward towards my next big adventure, the next thing I can do. Often, though, when I look back, I notice how much I've missed or forgotten. It's unsettling to look back and see a broken timeline with so many pieces of your life missing. And maybe after some work I can get the memories back, but I don't often get the time for that kind of careful reflection. 

Why do I always want to move forward and look ahead?


(The flawed belief that led to this is that, at a young age, I decided that if I didn't stop living in the past, I would never be able to genuinely connect with people. Because of this, I completely abandoned the past and allowed myself to forget so much of it.)

How much of your life do you remember?

When I look back over the course of my life, I get this uneasy feeling from all the gaps in my memory. 

I have this long held belief that if I don't remember my life, it's sort of like it never happened. 
(Maybe I need a specific example here to act as cause and effect?)
So why do I do forget? So many other people have a vast recollection of memories. This rich past that so elegantly paints the picture of who they are today. So why, why do I forget things so easily??  

Vlog style: Ask Jrnie "How good am I at remembering my life?"

There are 3 different tenses we can think of our life in.

This ones the target. We want to be present. At least that's what all the monks say. 
But presence is hard. Being present means you can't think about being present, because then you're not present anymore. You just have to do it. She doesn't have to try that hard with it, but we people seem to struggle with this one.

I spend most of my time here, between present and future. 
The future is a nice place to be. It's the land of big dreams, plans, and lists. It's easy to live in the future. You don't have to actually do anything. You're free to just dream all day. 

I turn 24 this week. I'm not naturally very introspective, but birthdays are always a time of reflection for me. I'm almost 1/4 of the way to 100, and it worries me that by living here, I'm letting too much of my life slip away. 


Because of this, I'm starting a new project.  I'm going to make a record every memory I can think of. Or at least the ones that feel noteworthy. (Define noteworthy on screen)


On and off for the last couple years, I've tried a variety of solutions for this, including taking photos, videos, journaling, having apps prompt me.

But none of them really stuck. I'll need to find a better method.

I also don't want to record everything. Lot's of things happen to us over the course of our lives, and it would be not only impossible to make note of everything, but also kind of useless. I like the idea of being able to reference my memory bank project to get a sort of snapshot of my life at any given moment. To do this, I'm going to need to decide what's worth remembering and what I'm okay with letting go of. 

I think it would also be worthwhile to get a better sense of how the brain actually stores memories, that way I can come up with a method that suits the way my brain already works. 

Research time.










I'm in the video industry, which means I make overpriced coffee out of a chemex each morning.

## Premise

##### *Who is this about?*
- Myself
- Anyone else who feels like they forget too much of their life.

##### *What do they want?*
- To remember more of our experiences and lessons throughout life.
- [[remember your life]]

### Conflict
##### *Why can't they get what they want?*
- The brain isn't designed to remember everything. 
- [[our world is full of distractions]]
- [[we forget most of life]]
- 


##### *What is surprising?*
- [[we shouldn't try to remember everything]]


### Stakes
##### *What happens if they don't get what they want?*
- We will forget our life
- [[forgotten life is equivalent to one that never happened]]


### Resolution
##### *How do they get what they want anyways?*
- [[living a noteworthy life means living in a way worth taking notes on]]
- [[writing is thinking]]
- [[pay attention to the world]]

##### *How does it end?*


### Lesson
##### *What can be learned from this?*
- Processes to implement that help remember life


### Extra Questions



# Metaphor
I'll make a lid for the chemex out of wood on the lathe. 

The steam escaping from the chemex is a metaphor for the memories of our lives escaping into nothingness right in front us. They're ephemeral. All of the solutions I'll propose are like the lid on the chemex, locking the vapor into the glass as our memories are locked into our minds.

# Hook
##### *How does the video start?*
- Something upbeat
- Life is full of beautiful moments, but we only remember a few. I think that's criminal.
- Question: How much of your life do you really remember?
	- Second question: If you don't remember it, what was the point of it happening? 
	- I'd argue we have a moral obligation to remember meaningful moments.
- Maybe instead we start with the coffee? or maybe thats the transition. Talk about habits, routine, mindfulness

# Script

Life is weird. Sometimes, moments fly past so quickly it's overwhelming. Other times, they seem to slowly crawl by.

How much of your life do you remember? If you're anything like me, probably not a big percentage. Why is this? And if we don't remember our life, where does it go? Those are the questions I want to explore in this video, and hopefully by the end I'll be able to provide a pretty simple guide to remembering your life. Let's get started.

BROLL and transition to body


The fact we have the opportunity to live this life and create memories is so insane because life is so rare and special. With this in mind, I feel this sense of moral obligation to remember meaningful moments. It feels to me that a life that we can't remember is about the same as if it had never happened at all. 

> "The unexamined life is not worth living." Socrates

So how do we remember everything? 

Well we don't. Not everything. We can't. There's no way. And we shouldn't even try. So step one is to define our terms and get clear on expectations.

According to Lisa Genova, neuroscientist and author of "Remember," our brains just weren't designed to remember that much information. Most of what we experience is forgotten, and that's actually a good thing. Forgetting is our default state. It helps us sort all of the random information our senses absorb in some sort of meaningful way. 

This default state of forgetting, to me, actually helps explain why we're such great storytellers. I've come to realize that storytelling is all about withholding information. The point of a good story is to preserve a moment of humanity, not to give every detail about a situation. Because of this, lots of details usually get left out. The same seems to be true in the case of our memories.

Imagine you have a camera setup on a busy city block. No matter what you're shooting this footage for, you don't want to keep every single frame of that video. Even if it's the most interesting block in the world, that's going to get boring and redundant after a while.

We don't need every bit of information in our stories, and we don't need every bit of information in our memories. We need the specific parts that help bring us back to how we felt during that experience, and the parts that help us learn from it.

Now that we have some grip on our attention again, we can focus on our lives and actually remembering them.

1. One of the more impactful practices I've found is writing down a story from each day. By doing this, we're forced to take what at the time felt like a bunch of random experiences, and string them together into a meaningful story. It feels almost like keeping a record of my life. Another benefit I've found from this is that, when I know I have to write a story about my day, I tend to live in a way that would make a better story. This simple practice can sort of force you into accidentally living a really interesting and engaged life. It makes me take another look at what would normally be a mundane routine, and try to think about it from a different angle.

2. Another thing I try to do is take plenty of photos and videos, but not so many that it pulls me away from actually experiencing life. I find that curating these after the fact helps me remember those experiences more vividly as well. 

3. I do my best to try new things as often as possible. It's been my experience that when I'm learning something new, my brain has to work a lot harder, and time seems to slow down a little. I end up remember these moments much more vividly than if I had just gone through a typical routine.

4. Finally, I try to have 1 or 2 really big, sort of year defining moments. That way, when I look back and think "what did I do in 2021," I can be like "oh yeah that's the year I got my pilots license and got a house with my girlfriend and one of our closest friends." This sort of high level view on life really helps me feel a sense of accomplishment when I look back at my life.  


Experiences can often feel like the steam lifting from fresh coffee. At first, it's hot, vivid. But over time our memories start to escape us, rising up and vanishing into thin air. All we can do is try to hold onto them as best as we can, reflecting and taking notes on what's most meaningful to us, because at the end of the day, living a noteworthy life just means living in a way worth taking notes on.
