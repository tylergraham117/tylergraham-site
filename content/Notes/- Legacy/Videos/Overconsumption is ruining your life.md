### Idea Dump
- More is not better. Better is better.
[[information curation age]]

In the (19whatevers), the age of information was born. 
Knowledge was power.

Check screen time and realize how much of your life you spend on your phone. Add it up over a lifetime.

Rabbit hole of youtube videos and internet searches that lead to over-consuming content.

Metaphor for over-consumption, like eating lots of sugar or buying a bunch of stuff.

People are in a constant state of input or output, and while its not necessarily one or the other, it can be helpful to think about it in a binary way so that we can find a balance between the two.

Examples of turning consumption into creation? (YT is an obvious one for me, and also a very current one.)

## Premise

##### *Who is this about?*
- People overwhelmed with consumption and procrastinating.

##### *What do they want?*
- To start using all their information and consumption for something good and start creating something.


## Conflict

##### *Why can't they get what they want?*
- Consumption is easy. It's addicting. Making stuff is hard and uncomfortable. 

##### *What is surprising?*
- Creating is way more exciting and fulfilling. 


## Stakes

##### *What happens if they don't get what they want?*
- A life of inaction and information overload.


## Resolution

##### *How do they get what they want anyways?*
- Start creating by interacting more with the things they consume until the balance is shifted.

##### *How does it end?*
- We start building a habit of creating things


## Lesson

##### *What can be learned from this?*
- Consumption and creation are on the same continuum. Both are essential parts of the human condition. Many of us have slipped way too far to the consumption side. We need to practice conscious consumption and use that to fuel our creation.

# Script

I want to live an intentional life, and I think most of the time, I'm pretty good at it. 

But. 

I like information.

You might be thinking, hey me too, what's so wrong with that?

Well, let me tell ya.

I like information, and it's way too easy for me to get it.

So easy that most of time, when I go for a simple search, it turns into something... else.

I spend hours consuming endless amounts of content. 

It's like going for a sip, and getting a firehose of information.

And usually we never even do anything with it. 

I've noticed that lots of times I end up forgetting most of what I've consumed, even if it felt engaging and inspiring in the moment. 







But before I tell you what I think that is, I want to tell you the story of an 18th century French philosopher by the name Denis Diderot.

Denis spent his early adulthood studying law, but abandoned that to pursue his the things he was more interested in, like literature and philosophy and language. He spend many years writing and teaching and translating to earn a living, never really making much money. 

In spite of that, he led a quite remarkable life. He wrote lots of incredibly influential essays, including one about teaching the blind how to read about 100 years before braille was invented. His most influential work was his contribution to the most comprehensive encyclopedia's in French history. I know, exciting stuff.
He had, in a sense, fame, but no fortune. But he seemed content with that.
 
Later in life, through means that are not exactly clear, he acquired a luxurious scarlet robe. 

And after that, he fell prey to something now known as the Diderot Effect. 

You see, as soon as he saw this beautiful new garment in the context of all of his other possessions, he noticed how out of place it was. He was made uneasy by the lack of coordination and unity in his living space, and started developing the urge to replace his old things to match the beauty of his new robe. He became reactive in his consumerism. 

"I was the absolute master of my old robe. I have become the slave of the new one." [The Essay](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/diderot/1769/regrets.htm)
He began to notice a void in his life that he had not seen before. (Quick cuts on "void")

The Diderot effect describes the spiral of consumption of things we don't need. 

Lots of times, we buy things we don't need because we think it'll help us become something we want to be. 

It's why you get a gym membership and never go, or buy kale and never eat it.

I think it also lends an explanation to why we endlessly scroll, mindlessly watch TV, and forget most of what we consume. It's reactionary consumption.


Just as buying new things often leads to buying more new things, consumption of information often leads to more consumption.



And all of this mindless consuming leaves little room for creation.

And people need to create. It's part of what makes us human. We've been making art for pretty much all of time.

I think consumption and creation work like a balance. We have inputs and outputs. 

In order to maintain a healthy relationship with either, they need to be somewhat equal.

But we're overloading ourselves with consumption.

To fix this, I'm going to spend the next week trying to balancing the scales. 

Here are the rules of my little experiment:

For every input, I'll have an output. 

Each thing I consume needs to prompt some sort of creation.

This means every movie, book, article, YouTube video, post on social media, anything.

It can be as simple as a quick note to myself or a comment to the creator.

I have an issue.

Actually I have a lot of issues.

But this particular issue derives from the tension I feel from all of the incredible things in the world. 

On the one hand, I love to admire these things. Art, nature, everything seems to inspire me so much.

On the other hand, if I spend all my time admiring beautiful and inspiring things, I'm too preoccupied by consumption to contribute anything. It becomes too much of a good thing.

And what's all this inspiration for at the end of the day?

	Core Idea: What is inspiration for if we don't create anything?

I've come to see inspiration as a spark of creative thoughts or new connections being formed in my brain as I experience something.

An idea I've heard over and over throughout my life is that everything creative comes from somewhere. 

"There is nothing is new under the sun."

I used to get discouraged by that because I thought I had to be original, but now I know that it's really a freeing idea.

It means that we can let go of the pressure of trying to create something completely new.

"You are, in fact, a mashup of what you choose to let into your life. You are the sum of your influences." ([[Steal Like An Artist (book)]])

Influence. 
From the Latin "influentem," meaning "to flow into, to stream in, pour in." 

	Core Idea: You are the sum of the things you let into your life, your influences.

In fifth grade, my teacher started a science club and asked me to be a part of it. The goal was to teach kids about ecology and preservation. He was really good at this stuff. 

I was 11 and didn't know what any of that really meant, so I said yes.

One time, he came into the class with this cart. On top was this tray that looked like a plastic slice of Earth. There were hills and valleys and rivers and streams. His goal was to teach us about the watershed. We would pour some water at the top and watch it flow throughout the landscape.

It was an incredible visual to teach us about how water picks up pollutants. 

Water has an innately cyclical nature to it. It's all recycled. 

I think creativity works in a similar way.

Everything comes from somewhere. A lake is the source for many rivers and streams. 
What is the source of our creative ideas? What sorts of pollutants do we pick up?
  


For anyone trying to discern what to do w/ their life: PAY ATTENTION TO WHAT YOU PAY ATTENTION TO. 


So I've decided to track all of the things I consume for __ days and see if I'm happy with what I find.



A function is when the variation of one thing determines the variation of another. 

Put another way, there's an input, a set of rules, and an output.

For example, when we load weight onto the left side of the balance, the right side changes too. The right side's height is a function of the left's. 

Similarly, our creativity is a function of our consumption. 

What we are able to create is directly influenced by what we consume.



The things we consume, then, have to reach a certain aspirational level of quality for us. They have to feel important. They need to help our brain better understand the world we live in by forging new connections between ideas.

And we need to keep track of them somehow so we can pull on our inspirations in the future.

Then, and this is the hard part, we have to actually act on them. 

I think the solution to my problem, then, is to channel all of those inspiring, wonderful things into the creation of something meaningful. 

Whatever that means.


*Join me next time where I overcome existential dread and explore the meaning of life*
*just kidding, I'll probably just do some gardening*

	Core Idea: Channel inspiration into something meaningful.


TRACK WHAT YOU CONSUME FOR 30 DAYS AND THEN TIE THAT IN (or go back 30 days)

We just have to watch, read, listen, or generally pay attention to a variety of things until we've got enough ideas to mix together and create something of our own.

The problem with social media is the endlessness of it. The function is broken. Rather than consuming and creating, we just keep consuming. The rules of the function don't force us to start creating anything. Said another way, we let our hunger for knowledge overshadow our need to take action. 

The solution then is to change the rules of the function. We just need to balance things out by paying attention to what we consume, and then take action on it by funneling those creative ideas into something meaningful.

What does this look like practically?

I think there's two main things I've learned to do with these ideas.

The first one is to pay attention to what we pay attention to. 
If we're careful about our inputs, and we're really selective about them, then we can assure we're getting the right types on inspiration. 

The second is the hard part. The part where we actually do something.
A good rule is to refuse to just agree or disagree with something. Instead, take immediate action. Any kind of action. It doesn't have to be big. It can be as simple as taking a note and saving it for later.  Use every inspiring idea as a seed. Maybe it'll grow into something big one day.  

Going back to the original question, how do we avoid being pulled into the black hole of social media, but still use the platforms?

I think the solution is to be selective. Only follow the content of people who actually add value to your life. If something you consume doesn't inspire you, there's not a huge reason to keep consuming it. Then, make something you think is valuable and meaningful, whatever that means to you.

For me, the result of recent inputs are this video. What are they for you?

### Notes

Choose better inputs. 
	[[input controls output]]

Reality isn't about what's real, it's about what we're able to pay attention to.
	Use a black background and a white foreground paper. Have a shadow project onto the background of some semi complex thing, and as the white paper moves across the shadow will appear on it. It will not appear on the black because it will be absorbed flat, so this gives a cool “masking” like effect, but practically.
	
Build a balance scale to represent the inputs and outputs I have throughout the day.

Imitate, then innovate.


Influences on this video: 
- Show Your Work!
- Steal Like an Artist
- Van Neistat
- Beau Miles: [[Such a breakthrough in thinking is to acknowledge that I have a uniqueness born of influences.]]

Now I'm editing and realizing I have to do an entire stop motion of the ecology bit because it needs some footage there and that's the best way to tell the story.

### Twitter

The Internet is full of incredible inspiration and knowledge.

The problem is, most people consume endlessly, but never use anything they learn or find in a productive way.

Here's how to change that:


When consume on social media, most of it has no impact on us. This content is mostly useless. 

Every once in a while, something will connect with us. This type of content is important. It becomes an influence on us. 

The word "influence" comes from the latin "fluere," meaning "to flow."

When water flows throughout a landscape, if picks things up along the way and carries it to the end. 

We do the same thing. We pick up little ideas and thoughts along the way and bring it into our creations. 

That means we need to pick up more influential things and less uninspiring content. Garbage in, garbage out.

Practically, this looks like unfollowing accounts that don't inspire you and engaging with things that do. Simple.

Now that we're inspired and moved by the things we're consuming, how do we use it productively?

Stop just agreeing or disagreeing with things that inspire you. Commit to some form of action, even if that just means taking a note of your thoughts. 

People are like functions. There's an input, a set of rules applied to it (our world view), and an output. The problem is that with endless scrolling, the function is broken and there's no output. 

We have to commit to action, to output, to fix the function.

Your influences make you unique. Nobody has the same ones as you. The most productive thing you can do with them is share how they shape your world view.
