# Altruism

Backlink: [[]]


Definition: the belief in or practice of disinterested and selfless concern for the well-being of others.

Altruistic people don't say "let me know if there is anything I can do to help." They already know, and they do it. Even further, they're not necessarily interested in what that does for them. Altruism is not a single good deed, its a habit in a way.


Relates to Steve Leder's The Beauty of What Remains. (Not read in book form, not noted yet.)
