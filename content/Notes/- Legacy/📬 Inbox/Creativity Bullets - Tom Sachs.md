### Output Before Input
In the morning, we should prioritize having some sort of output before we allow the input of the day to start. Overnight, our minds cleanse themselves and our subconscious runs wild. We should use the freshness that comes with that to create something, even something small and trivial. 

### Good, real inspiration is sacred
Inspiration in it's true form strikes seemingly randomly and seldomly, and should therefore be treated as a sacred thing.

### Be a thief
It is important to not get caught up in trying to be overly original. Creativity comes from connecting things, not from completely original thoughts. 

### Do what you love first
It is helpful to, first thing in the morning, do something you love. I find that this really impacts my happiness and overall productivity throughout the day. Starting off with something you have to do is terrible. You're forcing yourself into your day. In the opposite, you couldn't hold yourself back if you tried.

### Write ideas all the time
Ideas come to us all day. If [[Ideas come from the confluence of two separate things. It's when you collide those things that creative ideas happen]], then we should be on the lookout for those collisions and find the creativity as it walks past us, sometimes literally. Have a system of taking notes while living normal everyday life. I prefer on my phone, because I have it with me anyways.

### Environment is important
[[we are a function of our environment]]

### Start with cheap materials so you're not affected by them
With expensive materials, there is a real economic loss if you make a mistake. But sometimes mistakes lead to good things. Using expensive materials involves a sense of pressure that really isn't helpful when creating. It's helpful to start off with the cheap stuff so you can play around.
