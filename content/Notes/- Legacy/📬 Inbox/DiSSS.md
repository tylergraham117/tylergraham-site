This is an acronym for...

### Deconstruct
Break something down into it's most simple and basic parts.

##### Interview 
Find people that are really skilled at something and ask them questions.

### Select
Decide what you should be working on. Learn only the important things that are frequently used. You don't need all the details all up front. [[Pareto Principle]]

### Sequence
Learn something in an order that makes sense.

### Stakes
Give yourself something to work for. Often this can be negative, as we have a tendency to avoid negative situations more strongly than we try to create positive ones for ourselves.
