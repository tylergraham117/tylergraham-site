# Finding Video Ideas

There are lots of components to making a good video.

We have to think about lenses, lighting, sound, pacing, etc.

But the core idea is by far the most important part. Without an idea, we have no direction. 

Focusing on the other parts of a video without a great core idea is a lot like trying to upgrade a car with no engine. You might make it look better, but you're not going anywhere.


The Idea Engine is a way of generating ideas for videos. Here's the premise.

Creative people are observant people. The key is to make note of your observations. If you think something is interesting, write it down. I like to have a separate notes app that I only use to write down random thoughts throughout the day. 

Now, make it a habit to occasionally look at those notes and comment on them. Creative ideas come from the intersection between two seemingly random thoughts. We have to try to make connections. Go through your notes. Try to apply the cool technique you saw in a YouTube video to an idea you read in a book or on a social media post. The intersection of those ideas is where your new core idea can come from. 

Take that idea forward, and build on it. Connect more inspirations to it. Add other ideas together. 

If we make a habit of this, we can come up with endless ideas.
