Dr. Carol Dweck proposed a distinction between entity and incremental theories of intelligence. Entity, also known as fixed, tend to perceive their overall intelligence or skill at something to be set, likely from birth. Others believe that they must grow and learn incrementally over time. 
A growth mindset is crucial to success in many fields and areas of life. This is a mindset that can be honed, and even instilled in children if the foresight is there.
