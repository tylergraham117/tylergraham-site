### Hook
I want to start making YouTube videos. And I had an idea for a first video, but to make that video I needed to make this one. So here we are. 

I just recently moved into this house.

The idea I had involved a cool overhead spot light. The only problem is I just put in these cool overhead lights that light the garage really evenly. Great for working, not great for what I want to do. 

I got to thinking about how to light the shot. The obvious solution was to but a light on a stand. But that's incredibly boring. And I'd have to set it up and break it down anytime I wanted to do something similar. What a pain. 

MAKE THE THING THEN MAKE THE VIDEO
