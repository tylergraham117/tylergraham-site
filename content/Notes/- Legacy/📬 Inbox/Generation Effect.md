# Generation Effect

The Generation Effect is the phenomenon that people tend to remember things more effectively when it comes from their own mind rather than by passively observing things. By generating, we apparently jumpstart [[Semantic Memory]]. 

Ways to use this effect practically are to take notes, as I do here, or to write essays or make videos about topics I am interested in. Basically, rather than just inputting lots of stuff all the time, we have to output to finish the "Learning Cycle" so to speak. (Not sure if that is actually a cycle that exists I just labeled it that.)
