What does the ideal day look like from a health perspective?


- Wake up early
- View light first thing. This helps with circadian rhythm.
	- The ideal for this is to just take a walk first thing in the morning.
- Have a coffee after the walk. This gives adenosine time to clear out.
- No breakfast.
- Do some work, generally best to do something systematic at this time. 
	- Read, write (non creative), admin, systems.
- Exercise. 
- Lunch (better yet, skip lunch and have a tea or something instead, depending on the fasting window)
	- If lunch, something low in carbs. Higher in protein or fat. 
		- Veggies: Beans, nuts, seeds, broccoli, spinach, asparagus, artichokes, potatoes, sweet potatoes, avocado. etc. Most any veggie is ok.
		- Fish, sardines, etc.
		- Try to avoid regular meats here, but go ahead if not feasible.
		- Portion control. Drink water or tea before eating. Stop before full. 
- Later in the day, creative work.
	- Stop work in the afternoon.
- Plan the following day.
- Do things around the house, see family, friends, etc.
- Dinner, largest meal. Any macros okay. Mostly plants where possible. 
- If home around sunset, walk.
- Movies, TV, etc are best before sunset. If at night, try to have space before bed. Around 2 hours if possible.
- No screens in bed. 
- Read fiction at night.
- Sleep in a cool room.
