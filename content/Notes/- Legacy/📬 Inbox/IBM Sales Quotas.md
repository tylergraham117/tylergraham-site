# IBM Sales Quotas

Backlink: [[]]

Apparently, when IBM was at the height of its business size, they ran a system of sales contrary to the rest of the industry. In order to skyrocket their sales, their quotas were the lowest in the industry.

This concept carries over into many other fields as well.
