# Infrastructure by Colin Wright

In this essay, delivered via newsletter, [[Colin Wright]] explores the importance of infrastructure, especially while travelling. He makes the point that, while travelling, you must mostly live off of what you have in your bag and whatever infrastructure exists in the place you are travelling to. In other words, you get what you can carry and then a roll of the dice of whatever is available elsewhere. 

He also discusses his recent microphone quandaries and the fact that his current setup is better from a quality perspective because he is currently able to have a less portable system due to his more permanent (temporarily, at least) living situation. He discusses not wanting to let his setup become to permanent, though, because he does not want to rely on any given combinations of gear to get what he needs to do done. 

I relate to this in the sense that I have a tendency to build out a system to do something, and then sort of lose the ability to do that thing the same way if the system changes too much. I think the solution to this, if it needs one, which I think it does as reliance on any material objects is almost never useful long term, is to simplify my processes into the actions rather than the interactions with material things. For example, journaling for me is not 'typing on a typewriter,' its just 'writing.'
