### Notes

"It's just like riding a bike" is a common saying that refers to skills we generally don't forget how to do.

The thing is, we know how to ride a bike, but our specific bike degrades over time. Without consistent, proper maintenance, bikes get rusty and break.

This is also true for #on/imagination and #on/creativity, as well as #on/health, #on/criticalthinking, and pretty much anything else. We to constant exercise, constant progression, in order to hold onto a skill. 

If you're not moving forward, you're moving backward. 

The earth is always moving. So, if you're not traveling to your destination, the world it literally moving you along for you, without any input from you. Obviously this happens anyways, but its just a metaphor.
