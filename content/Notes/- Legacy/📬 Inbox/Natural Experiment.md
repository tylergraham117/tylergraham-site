# Natural Experiment

A natural experiment is generally an observation by economists where a naturally (natural as in without conscious experimental intent, not as in caused by nature) occurring event in the world can replace typical experimental procedures when they normally would be either not possible, not plausible, or even unethical to accomplish with normal experimental procedure.

An example of this is replacing the randomness of a blind, randomized, placebo controlled study with a naturally occurring event in the world.
