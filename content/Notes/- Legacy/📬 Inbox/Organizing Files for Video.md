# Organizing Files for Video

There are tons of options on how to organize your files. The most important thing, in my opinion, is to have some sort of system. What that system is matters less than having it. Without a system, files are organized differently on a per project basis, making it almost impossible to look back and find anything when you need to. 

It's important to include dates in your project files. If you're looking for something, you can located it based on date. Don't remember when something was? Look for photos on your phone you might have taken that can set you in the right direction. 

It's also beneficial to add some sort of descriptive wording to file names as well. This avoids having to think too hard about a date if you don't remember it, and allows you to simply read through the descriptions. 

A crucial part of any system is ease of use. If something is difficult to do, we stop doing it. People have a tendency to take the easiest path. If your system is complicated, you won't do it. 


Some ways around this:

- Template Folder
A template folder allows you to copy and paste a folder that contains an entire folder tree within it. All of your organization is a few clicks away. Simply rename the main template and you're good to go.

- Post Haste
This is a free software I've used for a while that makes things so much easier. You set up a template within the software, and whenever you're ready to open a new project, you open the software, enter the necessary information into some fields, and press create. Post Haste then automatically creates folders and project files in your default location (whether that be a set folder or an external hard drive).
