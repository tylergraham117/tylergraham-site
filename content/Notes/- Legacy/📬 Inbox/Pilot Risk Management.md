In aviation, there is inherent risk. You are basically attaching an engine, which relies on small, controlled explosions, to a large metal tube with flammable liquid inside. You are then using heavy object that to go into the sky and travel around like a bird. So it's obviously risky. The goal, then, is to manage that risk as much as possible.

This can be done through a variety of different things. One of the big ones is simply assuring everything is working the way it is supposed to. This is done in a pre-flight check.
