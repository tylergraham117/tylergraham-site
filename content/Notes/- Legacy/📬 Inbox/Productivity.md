The idea of productivity in today's culture is interesting. It seems to assume that producing something is important, which maybe it is. But I think the more important question is *what* are we producing? What is the value of that?

Sometimes, we seem to want to be productive for the sake of being productive. I think really what we are doing here is producing more time for ourselves to explore other areas of our lives.
