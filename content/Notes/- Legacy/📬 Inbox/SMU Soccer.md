In SMU's soccer program, they work really hard, as any athletes do, on their technical ability. Apparently, though, after a certain point, the amount of work they are doing on that technical ability tends to have diminishing returns. In response to that, the coaches turn their attention towards focusing on other things, such as decision making skills. 

In soccer, the ability to make quick decisions is absolutely paramount to the success of a player.

At a certain point, it seems like it is actually less useful to work on honing your skills and more useful to work on the mental agility and fast paced critical thinking to make the right decision in the moment.
