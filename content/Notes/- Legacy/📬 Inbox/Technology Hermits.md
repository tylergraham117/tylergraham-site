This guy, [Nolan Lawson](https://nolanlawson.com/2021/08/26/my-love-hate-affair-with-technology/), refuses to to most technology. The surface level reasons are that he is concerned with privacy and morals and open-sourced software. On a deeper level, he seems to enjoy fixing things and tinkering with the software.
