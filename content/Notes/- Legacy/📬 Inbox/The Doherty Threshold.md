# The Doherty Threshold

The Dohery Threshold is a design concept that basically identifies the time between a computers ability to respond to human input and the humans ability to think of the next thing it wants to accomplish. By making sure the computer, whether it be the actual computer itself or the software we use, can actually keep up with us and our thoughts, we ensure that we don't pull ourselves out of any sort of [[Flow]] states we might have worked so hard to get into.
