The classic debate optimism and pessimism, of whether the glass is half empty or full, is a common and cliche one. Another cliche is adding other glass related metaphors. Here's mine: There is value in the empty space of any class that is largely unnoticed. 

In a cup of coffee, there is almost always a bit of room at the top. This room is where aromas develop. Smell is a significant part of the pleasurable experience when it comes to coffee. Thus, that emptiness is necessary to fully enjoy the coffee.
