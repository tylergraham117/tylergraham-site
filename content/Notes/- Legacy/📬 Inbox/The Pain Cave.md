# The Pain Cave

The Pain Cave is a concept common in ultra running in which the runner will retreat into their psycological "pain cave" in order to feel a sense of satisfaction in spite of all their suffering, or even because of it. The idea is that, to get to this point, you have to accomplish something really difficult, so it's a really big deal if you can make it that far.
