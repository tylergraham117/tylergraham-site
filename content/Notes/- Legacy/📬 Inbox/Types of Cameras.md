Backlink: [[How to Make Videos]]


There are three types of cameras that are important to know about when you want to make videos.

- DSLR
- Mirrorless
- Cinema
- Point and Shoot
- Specialty

Each has specific benefits and drawbacks. 

**Mirrorless**
These cameras are amazing. They give the option to switch lenses, there's a huge range of quality (mostly dependent on budget), and they're very portable.

**DSLR**
This type of camera is on its way out of popularity as far as video is concerned. They're a little bigger than mirrorless cameras and their quality ceiling is lower.

**Cinema**
This is the next step up from mirrorless. These cameras shoot at higher qualities and have more options.

**Point and Shoot**
Useful for quick shots or as a B camera. Often lack the ability to switch lenses (although there are now exceptions), which can be limiting. However, the size and cost associated with these cameras could balance that out. These cameras are a different type of tool, and they have their uses. 

**Specialty**
These types of cameras include things like action cameras, drones, cameras built on gimbals, etc. They are often built for a specific purpose. This makes them less useful overall, but incredibly good at what they were designed to do. These types of cameras are best as secondary tools.
