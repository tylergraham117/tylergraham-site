### Intro

"Story is king." 

"You videos don't matter if there's no story."

We've all heard something along those lines. And I agree. 

The problem is, that's not very helpful.

I *know* story is important, but how do I actually tell better stories? More than that, how do I come up with stories in the first place?

I don't have all the answers to this, mostly because I believe telling stories is a largely personal pursuit, but I will share some of what I've learned.


### What is a Story?

In the book A Million Miles in a Thousand Years, Donald Miller presents his idea of story and how to apply it to your life. He's studies stories and their structure for a long time and now uses the frameworks he's developed to teach marketers. In case you didn't know, marketers are some of the best storytellers in the world. They tell stories so convincing that they get you to separate yourself from the cash you've worked so hard for to buy into them.

So what is a story?

A story, according to Don, is a this:

**A story is a character that wants something and overcomes conflict to get it.**



### A Character
A story has a character. The character can be anyone, or even anything (usually personified). 

The character needs to be understood by the audience quickly. A story without a clear character is not a story, it's just an empty environment.


### That Wants Something
The character has to want something. They need a goal, some sort of progression we can join them on.  What they want should be important to them. 


### And Overcomes Conflict 
The character has to struggle to get what they want. If your character wants something and gets it immediately, that's a boring story. 


### To Get It
The character ultimately overcomes the necessary struggles and gets what they want. They usually come out of this changes in some way. They learn something. 


### The Surprise

To make a story more interesting, it needs some sort of surprise. Good storytelling is all about withholding information.

This is why we cut, crop, edit.

We don't need the whole world in our story. We need to tell the specific parts of it that evoke emotion and take us on a ride. Doing this lets us see the world differently. We get a new perspective.

If you have a surprise, save it. Don't give it away at the beginning. If you do, the rest of the story will be boring. Nobody cares about the little details when they already know the point of the story. 


### The Guide

Many stories have a guide. They usually come into the story to help the character get what they want. They've been there, done that. They know what to do, and now they want to help the character do it too. 


### Application

Now let's apply it. You have a vague idea for a video. How do we make sure the story is solid?

Story is a character that wants something and overcomes conflict to get it.

Make sure you can answer these questions:
Who is your character?
What do they want?
What do they overcome in order to get that thing?
Who is the guide? How do they help?
What is surprising in this story? Did I withhold that long enough?


Stories help the spirit of humanity. They help us pass on lessons we've learned. They contain truths.

All of this can feel daunting at first, but don't worry. It gets easier. Start by filling the in the boxes. Start writing down stories about your life. Interesting things happen to you all the time. Practice putting them into the format of a story. 

You may need to move the facts around a little. That's fine. Storytelling helps us convey what was felt, what was learned. The structure of story helps us pass on what we experienced in a more honest way. Don't let the facts get in the way of the truth. You owe it to your audience.
