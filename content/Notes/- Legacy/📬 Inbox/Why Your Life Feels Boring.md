Backlink: [[020 Video Ideas]], [[Story]]


Most of us do about the same things every day. That routine gets boring, and we become disengaged with our own lives. We lose our sense of purpose. We end up leaving the overarching story of our life up to chance, and chance doesn't usually do a very good job. 

To fight this, we have to make sure we outline clear ambitions for ourselves, build habits that lead to a sense of purpose, and avoid playing the wrong character in the story of our life.

### Idea Dump
- Your life is a series of moments. Moments governed by what you pay attention to. 
	- Moments make days, days make weeks, weeks years, a lifetime. (So a good life is a collection of these)
	- We need to fill the carousel with moments that are important to us.
- Build an old fashion projector from that book and fill it with moments. We need to live in a way that fills this thing up.
- Life is simply a collection of moments, and it's our responsibility to make those moments meaningful. 

- How to make your life more interesting
- How to have an interesting life
- Do more cool stuff
- Why your life is boring
- Why life feels boring

- Life being interesting or boring is an entirely internal thing.
- Who are interesting people? What do they do?
- If you want to be interesting, be interested
- Curiosity is the antidote to a boring life
	- What has this done in the past?
- If something gets hard, don't get mad, get curious.
- Curiosity requires humility.
- Life can't always be interesting. It ebbs and flows.
- If someone is excited about something, it's really easy for them to get me excited about it. Excitement is contagious.
- Hedonic Treadmill
- Novelty
- What does the day to day experience look like to the happiest people on earth?
- We don't need to think of life as a highlight reel. The boring days can matter just as much, and they deserve just as big of a spot on our Carousel and the massive highlight moments do. 
- Life is kind of supposed to be boring a lot of the times
- We often live for the future possibility of living a good life, but life is right now. We have to life for that life. 
	- Procrastination makes life boring. Do the thing now. Take an action.
-  Do something you're proud of everyday. 
- Make stuff for yourself. You'll feel accomplished and proud each time you use or see it.
- Boredom is simply a failure to pay attention (from Sam Harris app). 

- We often think of life as our own hero's journey, which is helpful, but I think within that is a bunch of smaller hero's journeys. 

- Encourage people to explore their own creativity even if they don't feel like they have any.
	- Talk about how I was never creative growing up, but turned it into something I did professionally.

[[Hero On A Mission (book)]]

- Everything has boring bits.
- We have this tendency to think we have find our passion or purpose, but it's the singularity that makes this wrong. We as people have the capacity to do so much.
- 

- A while back, Jrnie took me to this used book store. It was filled with stories information. She found a small book in there about making paper movie machines. That's the carousel of moments. Fill up the carousel.

- When you file for a flight plan, you have to tell them where you're headed. What's the destination? You're allowed to cancel that plan at any point along the way. Don't be in the sky without a place to go.
- The point is to get off the ground. You'll never go anywhere if you don't take off.

- I don't pretend to have the answers to the big questions like "what's the meaning of life?" I've just decided that it's not really my place to answer that. I've had it all wrong. Life is asking *me* that question. "What is the meaning of you?" And now it's my job to find an answer to that question.

It can be scary to take risks and jump into a new story, but all you need is a little bit of courage. [[twenty seconds of insane courage]]
20 seconds, lots of times, compounds into a really inspiring life.

What are you putting into the world that didn't use to be there?



The keys of meaning:
- Follow your creativity.
- Be curious (follow it into novelty)
- Push yourself into interesting stories.
- Include others.
- Approach life with optimism.



Life is driven forward by clearly defined ambitions.

# Script

Most of us do about the same thing every day.

We wake up. Make some coffee. Water the plants. Walk the dog. Read, write, work. Eat. Exercise. Scroll social media, watch Netflix. Go to bed. (Repeat.) 

This is my life on most days.

It gets repetitive. And I think when life gets l repetitive like this, it can be hard to find meaning in it. 

We go on autopilot. 


Life. Gets. Boring. 

Not boring by some sort of social standard, but boring to you. You become disengaged and dispassionate about your own life. 

As a result, we start feeling unsatisfied.
 
We search for a sense of purpose in other people's lives instead of our own. (scrolling social media)

The days get more and more repetitive.

More boring.

Devoid of any sense of meaning.

It's a sort of self perpetuating cycle.


When we allow our lives to get boring and lose our sense of purpose, we leave the story of our life up to fate.

and "fate is a terrible writer."


Earlier this year I read a book about this. 

Donald Miller says we should think of our life as a story, like a movie or a novel. 

If our life is a story, then it's our job to figure out what that story is about. 

Before we can do that, we have to understand what kind of character we're playing.


*Stop Motion*


Every story has four primary types of characters:

There's the victim, the villain, the hero, and the guide.

We play all of these characters at different points in our life. 

Sometimes, we play the victim. We feel stuck, like there's no way out of whatever situation we're in. We feel helpless, and like something in our environment has to change before we can finally live the life we want. Victims don't do anything on their own. They just wait for help.

Other times, we play the villain. Villains are often carrying a pain through life that they haven't been able to deal with. They make others feel small because they view them as less important, and lash out against a world that's hurt them.

Sometimes we play the hero. We become the hero when we know what we want out of life, and we're willing to overcome the challenges in our way to get it. The hero gets to go on big transformational adventures.

Finally, we play the guide. This is the character in the story that helps and teaches the hero. We play this character when we help others by passing our understanding of the world to whoever is coming behind us, so that their story can be even better than ours.

At any point in our life's story, we are playing one of these four characters. 


The character we decide to play determines the quality of the story we get to write for ourselves.

The hero character is the one that we all root for in a movie, and it's the character that experiences the biggest transformation from beginning to end. 

The biggest hallmark of the hero character is that they know what they want. 
They have a clearly defined ambition.
And they understand that they have everything they need within them to pursue that ambition.

If you're watching a movie, you should be able to know exactly what the main character wants at any given time.

If you don't, then you lose interest in the movie. 


The same is true for your life. If you don't know what you want, then you'll lose interest in it.

Your life feels boring because you haven't outlined a clear ambition.

Part of finding meaning in our lives is accepting that we have the ability to pursue our ambitions. This sounds simple, but it isn't always.

We grow up in environments that tell us what roll we're supposed to play in society. 

We go to school, we do our homework, we go to soccer practice, we see some friends.
Every year, there is a clear mark of forward progress.
Even into adulthood, these prewritten cultural scripts continue, they're just less rigid. We get a job, work for promotions, get married, buy a house, the list goes on. 

And then one day the scripts run out. We have to decide what we want on our own.

This can be challenging.


Lot's of people, myself included, find it hard to want things. I think there are 3 main reasons for this:


1. Many of us grow up thinking that resources are scarce. Later in life, this can make us feel that by wanting something we're taking it from someone else. 
But ambition is not a zero sum game. If you have an interesting life, you're not taking someone else's ability to do the same. There's not a finite amount of interesting.

2. Some of us are raised in very strict environments. Then, we grow up and realize that some of the practices and limitations we were raised with aren't for us anymore. This leaves us confused and unsure about where to go next after living within such clearly defined boundaries for so long.
We have to understand that those old boundaries are gone. Trying new things lets us find where the new boundaries are.

3. Lots of us are paralyzed by choice. The world is huge and full of possibilities, and it can be hard to decide what the best thing is.
This is probably the one I struggle with most. 

When I was getting my pilots license, I learned how to file a flight plan. 
These are used so pilots can communicate with the tower and get some help finding their destination.

When you file for a flight plan, you have to tell them where you're headed. "Where do you want to go?" is the main question that needs to be answered.

But here's the thing. 

You're allowed to cancel that plan at any point along the way. You literally just hop on the radio and ask.


I think this is the same way ambitions work. We can't be in the sky without a place to go, but we're always allowed to change course if we realize that the direction we're going isn't for us anymore.

I try to remind myself this if I find myself worried about committing to a big ambition. You can always just cancel.
The main thing is just to get off the ground. We never go anywhere if we don't take off.

Basically, just do something until you can do something else. Then do that thing.



So that's it?

To stop having a boring life, we just have to want stuff?

Well, kinda, yeah. But also no.

What kind of stuff should we want? And how do we figure out specific things to do? 

Here's a handful of things I use to prompt myself when I'm feeling stuck:

The keys to a meaning life:
- Follow your creativity.
- Be curious (follow it into novelty).
- Forced adventures.
- Include others.
- Approach life with optimism.
- Go new places.


**Creativity**
For a long time, creativity felt like some mystical ability that I absolutely did not posses. Only people with cool hats and lots of life experience had it. 

Then, I found out that's not what creativity is. 

Creativity is just the process you go through to put something into the world that wasn't there before. 

It's just making something. Anything.

I like to build stuff. 
This cutting board was an exercise in creativity. So was this table. And this painting.
Now, anytime I see any of these things, or anything else I've been a part of creating, I feel a deep sense of satisfaction. 
It's hard to be bored with your life when you spend time building a world with a little more you in it.


**Curiosity**
Anytime someone does something interesting, it starts with curiosity. 
These are the "what if" questions.
You see something that looks interesting, and you start to wonder.

Following these questions to their inevitable answer often brings us into new and exciting adventures and experiences. 


**Forced Adventures**
A classic point in the hero's journey is the refusal of the call. 
This is where the hero knows what they have to do, but they're hesitant.
They need a push. This push is called the inciting incident.

I try to practice these through something I call Forced Adventures.
This is where you think of something you can do within a day, or even a couple hours, that will push you a little bit outside your comfort zone. 

Doing this starts to build the habit of pushing yourself into more meaningful and exciting stories, so when opportunities come in real life, we don't refuse them.


**Include Others**
A big part of living a meaningful life is realizing that it's not all about us. 
One of the most gratifying and fulfilling parts of life is sharing experiences with other people.

A while back, I had a "what if" question surface. I was following a lot of endurance athletes on social media and I thought "I wonder if I could run a marathon?"

Rather than doing it myself, I texted a friend and he foolishly agreed to do it with me. 

It wasn't a big deal, or even a real race, we just got dropped off at about marathon distance away and ran home. 

I don't think this experience would be as meaningful to me if it wasn't shared with a good friend.

Doing hard things with people you care about builds helps build rich relationships.


**Approach Life With Optimism**
Life comes with challenges and hardships. 
Often, these are the most influential parts of our lives.

I want to be clear here: This is not to romanticize suffering. 
Hardships suck.
But it's important to realize that obstacles are inevitable.
Every hero's journey has trials.
Having the ability to reflect on these challenges and find out how they enrich our lives is part of living with purpose.

Another side of this is being optimistic about change. 
Change can be scary, but we should try to embrace it.
Everything changes. 
The unique gift of people is that we are alive, so we get to decide what we want to change into.
Everything else just gets changed by it's environment.
I think we should take advantage of this ability to write our story in a more compelling direction.


**New Places**
Changing your physical environment can help spark excitement back into your life.
If I feel stuck, often the thing that get's me out of that is a change of scenery. 

I think this is pretty self explanatory. 
New places give us new thoughts and new experiences. 
And it doesn't have to be big change in environment.
Just go for a walk down a path you haven't been before. 
Or buy a plane ticket. 
Up to you.



A while back, Jrnie took me to this really cool used book store. 

It was filled with shelves of amazing stories.

One of the books she found was an old guide to making paper movie machines.

A lot of them look like carousels, but instead of weird horses, they're moments. 

This got me thinking about how life is like a carousel of moments.

It's a series of individual moments that, when sped up, look like a movie of our life.
Moments turn into days, days turn into weeks, weeks into months, months into years, and years into the sum total of our lives.
  
How we decide to spend each moment is how we spend our life.

Life doesn't happen later. 
It's not some future even that we're preparing for. 
It's happening now, in this moment.

I want to clarify that not every day is a big dramatic story.

This isn't about creating some sort of highlight reel of your life. 
Real life doesn't look like an instagram feed.

The story of real life has boring moments.

But that doesn't matter. 
It's about how we *feel* about those boring moments.

If you can wake up, make coffee, water the plants, read, write, work. Eat. Exercise. Walk the dog. Go to bed. Repeat..

and feel a deep sense of purpose while you do it, then you're on the right track.

The subplots of our days create the overarching stories of our lives.

We can infuse each day with a deep sense of purpose. 

All we have to do is have a clear ambition and engage in some practical methods that help us get there.
(Engage in creative pursuits, follow our curiosity, go on Forced Adventures, include others, be optimistic, and go new places.)



I don't have kids, but hopefully one day I will. 

I often think about what I'll tell them when they start asking the Big Questions (tm).

Questions like "why are we here?" and "what does it all mean?" 

I don't really know. 

And honestly, it's really none of my business. It's not my job to interrogate life and figure out what it means or what it wants.

I think it's actually the opposite. Life is interrogating us. 

It seems to be asking: "What is the meaning of you?" and "Why are you here?"

And it seems to be rooting for us. Life is on the edge of it's seat, waiting to see what we do with our short time here. 

We all get our own Carousels, and it's our job to fill it's contents with meaning.

### Stolen Ideas

We, as people, are the people controlling our lives, and we have the responsibility to shape them how we seem fit. Meaning is a job for us.

If our life is a story, then we need to figure out what that story is about. Before we can do that, we have to understand what character we are playing.

The character we play determines the quality of our story.

There are 4 internal archetypes. 4 primary types of characters.
- Victim: Feels like they have no way out.
- Villain: Makes others feel small.
- Hero: Willing to face challenges and transform.
- Guide: Helps the hero.

"I don't think any of us should trust fate to write the story of our lives.
Fate is a terrible writer." - Miller


##### Victim

- Your lead character cannot act like a victim. That's a terrible main character.
- A story has to move forward to be interesting.
- Real victimhood is real, but it's a temporary state.


##### Villain
- Heroes and villains often have similar backstories. The difference is how they choose to get 
out of their victimhood. 
- Carrying pain they haven't dealt with.
- Seeks vengeance against the world that hurt them.
- We are being villains when we dismiss others or think of them as lesser, or reduce them to outward appearances rather than understanding them. 


##### Hero
- Wants something out of life and is willing to accept challenges in order to transform into someone capable of getting what they want.
- A story moves forward when a hero responds with purposeful action and a sense of hope.
- Curiosity is often the seed of greatness. 


##### Guide
- The guide is a hero near the end of his journey.
- We live to pass our understanding of life on to those who come behind us so their stories can be better than ours. This is the point of the guide.
- It is meaningful to sacrifice ourselves for the sake of another.

"One of the great tragedies a person can experience is to feel dispassionate about their own life."
