##### Sit or Stand?
Both. The issue isn't sitting or standing, it's being in one position for extended periods of time. It's best to alternate every 20-30 minutes or so. Even better, move around in between.

##### Timing
The type of work you do depends on how long it's been since you've woken up.

 (~0-8 hours after waking up). During this phase, the chemicals norepinephrine, cortisol, and dopamine are elevated in your brain and body. Alertness can be further heightened by sunlight viewing, caffeine and fasting. Phase 1 is ideal for analytic “hard” thinking and any work that you find particularly challenging. It isn’t just about getting the most important stuff out of the way; it is about leveraging your natural biology toward the best type of work for the biological state you are in.

(~9-16 hours after waking). At this time, serotonin levels are relatively elevated, which lends itself to a somewhat more relaxed state of being—optimal for brainstorming and creative work.

(~17-24 hours after waking up) is when you should be asleep or try to sleep. During this phase, do no hard thinking or work, keep your environment dark or very dim and the room temperature low (your body needs to drop in temperature to fall asleep and stay asleep).

##### Time Blocking
Break your time into blocks. Let's use 30 minutes. Dedicate blocks for each task for the day. Do *only* that thing during this block. If finished, move on. This will help eliminate distraction.

##### To-Do List
Only have a few things on the list per day. Have a priority, a single most important thing to do that day. If you do it, the day was generally successful. No more than 7 things on the list per day. No more than 3 large tasks.
