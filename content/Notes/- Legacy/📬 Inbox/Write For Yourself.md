When writing, we should try to write for one person. Not a mass of people. If you write for a mass of people, say a thousand, it will drive you mad because you can't possibly consider the preferences of that many people at once. If you write for one obsessive person, you can be particular about how you write. 

When starting an essay, write who you are writing for. Describe them in extreme detail. 

When you write for one person, you're really writing for one kind of person. This is similar to the marketing strategy of picking a person and marketing to them. You build out their character relatively deeply in effort to figure out their hypothetical preferences, biases, and factors that drive them.
