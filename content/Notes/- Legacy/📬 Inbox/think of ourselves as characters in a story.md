There are four roles we rotate through as we go throughout life:
- The Hero
- The Victim
- The Villain
- The Guide

These roles have different views on the world, and we all have the potential to be any of them.


The **Victim** is a common one. We often move into playing the victim during hard times. The problem with being the victim is that victims don't really go anywhere. They're helpless, and stay that way. Victims feel that something must change in the external world before they can finally live the life they want.
This is different than being an actual victim of a tragedy. In this case, victimhood is real but temporary.


The **Villain** is often carrying pain that they haven't been able to deal with, so they lash out and seek vengeance against the world that has wronged them. We become villains when we make others feel small, when we views others as less, or dismiss them rather than trying to understand them.

The **Hero** is ambitious. We become this when we want something out of life and are willing to accept and overcome the obstacles that may arise along the way. It's when we understand that challenges are more like curriculum than opportunities to fail. Often, the seed of the hero character's ambition is curiosity. A story progresses when a hero is able to respond to situations with purposeful action and a sense of hope.

The **Guide** is a hero nearing the end of their journey. We become the guide when we help people do things we've been able to do. Guides help others pass on their understanding to those who come behind them so that their stories can be even better.
