#on/paradox 

When surrounded by similar pieces, art seems to lose its value. I think this is most noticeable on platforms like Instagram. Originally, when I came across an a great photo, I would come out of the experience really inspired. Now they all seem to look the same. It's an unfortunate effect, because it really devalues all of the work that the artists put in. 

I think this effect relates to the [[paradox of value]].

This is where the value of the [[tokonoma]] becomes useful. Singling out a piece of art forces one to really appreciate it. This is also why museums layout their art in such a careful and meaningful way.


# Art On Our Walls Become Wallpaper
#on/art #on/intention 

Wallpaper is a relatively lowly regarded object in the home. We put it there and over time forget about its existence. This isn't because we dislike it. Wallpaper, like anything, loses its novelty over time. It's like a [[hedonic treadmill]] of sorts. 

To avoid this with the art we hang, we need conscious, intentional interaction. The [[tokonoma]] does this beautifully. This can also be achieved by simply only putting up artworks that are currently meaningful to you, and take them down as soon as you notice that to no longer be the case.
