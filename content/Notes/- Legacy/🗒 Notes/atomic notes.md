An atomic note is a note that is concise and self-sufficient. It can be understood entirely on it's own without the need for context of other content beyond definitions.

This type of note taking, or note making rather, is the antithesis of the hoarding, collection style note taking where you just save everything to you notes app, never to be seen again.

Note taking is important, because [[we shouldn't try to remember everything]]. It's better to get ideas out into an environment we can actually use them.

Another advantage of atomic notes is that it forces you to [[create your own thoughts]] rather than simply collecting information from others.
