The benefit of crisis is that is shapes what we become, because [[we have to lose what exists to create something new]]. In order for something great to form, we often see the destruction of the previously best conceivable scenario.

This idea is explored in:

Crises are often feared. This is warranted, but there are intrinsic benefits to these events that change, usually for the better, the course of life or history.

People don't set out to build mediocre societies. They do the best within the reality they live. When a new generation comes along who was raised in said society, they are able to see it with fresh eyes. To them, the current society is not something that was built through decades of hard work. They were born into it. It simply is. As a consequence, this generation can clearly see the flaws in the fabric of society, and they have a drive to change it, just as the generation before did. To create a better world, we have to destroy, at least in part, the one that existed before it. This is the paradoxical nature of a crisis. Death is not simply death. It is the created of space for rebirth. 

This is, in part, why [[cities are iterative]].
