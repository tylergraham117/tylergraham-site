Many times, I've found myself echoing the thoughts of others rather than creating my own. A big part of this is [[imposter syndrome]], but I think something deeper is going on here. 

I have a desire to live in a way that is mostly based on fact, or at least as close as we can come to that. It's [[evidence based living]]. The problem with this is that it leaves little room for experimentation. Since [[diversity drives progress]], experimentation is crucial. You have to be willing to engage in [[divergent thinking]] and [[follow your curiosity]]. Since [[creativity is the processes of creating connections]], we have to go down new paths in order to bring new ideas to life and create those connections.

To find new exciting ideas, we have to realize that our perception of fact is the most important part about them. It's our interpretation of our surroundings that gives them usefulness, and [[everyone has a different perspective on the world]]. 

In this process of writing, what I'm really doing is searching for truth because [[writing is thinking]]. 

Not everything you say or think needs to have a source cited. It's okay to say you believe something without having to explain where that belief came from. 

On the flip side, the more connections and sources that lead to similar conclusions, the closer to truth an idea likely is. It's helpful to have other people's thoughts, especially those who are already well respected, to back up your own. You can [[verify your ideas with other's ideas]]. Just don't lean on them entirely. You're not just trying to promote other people's thoughts, you're trying to make your own.
