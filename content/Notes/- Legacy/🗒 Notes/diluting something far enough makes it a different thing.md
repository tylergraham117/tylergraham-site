If you have a cup of juice, and you dilute it with water, there's a point where it stops being juice and starts being water that tastes a little juicy. This is true of observations and information as well. If we oversimplify something in order to explain it to an audience that has less context of the thing we're explaining, it's really easy to convey the wrong thing in efforts to make it more digestible. This is absolutely something to be aware of when sharing knowledge to others.

The other side of this is avoiding "industry talk" or insider knowledge.
