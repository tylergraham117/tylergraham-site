Divergent thinking is a way of perceiving the world through an interconnectedness that breaches industry or discipline and looks more deeply at conceptual ideas. It is by definition a more creative lens to see the world because [[creativity is the processes of creating connections]]. This is what we mean when we say "think outside the box."

Thinking this way helps one to avoid [[parallel trenches]] of thought, as discussed in [[Range]].

To promote this way of thinking, we have to realize that [[diversity drives progress]], in this case diversity of knowledge.
