Frequency illusion, also known as the Baader-Meinhof Phenomenon or recency bias, is a [[cognitive bias]] in which, after noticing something for the first time, there is a tendency to notice it more often, leading someone to believe that it has a high frequency. 

The classic example is when you buy a new car, you start to see it everywhere, even though you never saw any before you owned that car.

This bias probably explains why [[we find what we're looking for]].
