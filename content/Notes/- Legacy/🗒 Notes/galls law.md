Gall's law states that any complex system must evolve from simpler systems that work. To build a complex system that works, you must start with a very simple one and improve it over time through use.

By recognizing this, we can create more effective systems without losing track of them or overbuilding things that are destine to break. This is crucial to remember when designing a way to [[remember your life]] through [[atomic notes]].
