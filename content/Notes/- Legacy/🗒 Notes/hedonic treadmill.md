The Hedonic Treadmill refers to the observation that we, as humans, have a general baseline for happiness or unhappiness. This baseline is our typical state of being. As we move throughout our lives, we will move up or down off of this baseline temporarily. 

It seems that the baseline can be changed through consistent exposure to the desired outcome.

The hedonic treadmill explains why [[anything can become monotonous]]. 

Similarly, it may explain why [[art is less valuable when surrounded by similar art]]. Our baseline for amazement and awe is raised, and we get so used to inspiring things that they cease to be inspiring.
