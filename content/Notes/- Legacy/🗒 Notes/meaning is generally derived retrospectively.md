# meaning is generally derived retrospectively



In life, meaning is generally derived retrospectively. We don't fully appreciate how impactful moments are to us until after they occur. We need time to ponder the experience, as well as further experience after the fact, before we can really understand how these experiences impact us.

We often think we need to do more and more, but silence serves as time to reflect, and brings just as much to the table as the noise and movement does. The [[rests are part of the music]].
