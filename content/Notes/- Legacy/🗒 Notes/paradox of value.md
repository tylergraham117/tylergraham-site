# Paradox of Value

> The **paradox of value**  (also known as the diamond–water paradox) is the contradiction that, although water is on the whole more useful, in terms of survival, than diamonds, diamonds command a higher price in the market. The philosopher Adam Smith is often considered to be the classic presenter of this paradox, although it had already appeared as early as Plato's Euthydemus.  Nicolaus Copernicus, John Locke, John Law and others had previously tried to explain the disparity.

In basic terms, things that are vital to human survival yet plentiful are less valuable on the open market than less useful things of scarcity. 

This is also often called the diamond-water paradox, because these objects are great examples of the phenomenon. Diamonds, though virtually useless to us other than as a symbol, are incredibly expensive. Water is cheap, despite our need for it to survive, because it is plentiful. 

It's the most extreme version of supply and demand. 

These judgements of value apply to everything, including people in the workplace.

People whose jobs are essential to the functioning of our society are often payed relatively little because the skills required to do those jobs are relatively common. Professional athletes on the other hand, have incredibly specific skills that few can replicate, and although their work is not necessary for the survival of our species, it is values higher because of it.
