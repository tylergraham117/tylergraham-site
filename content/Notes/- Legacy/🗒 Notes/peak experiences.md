Peak experiences are "...a highly valued experience which is characterized by such intensity of perception, depth of feeling, or sense of profound significance as to cause it to stand out, in the subject's mind, in more or less permanent contrast to the experiences that surround it in time and space." (Leach, "Meaning and Correlates of Peak Experience," 1962)

Abraham Maslow was the first to describe this concept. 

Peak experiences tend to be times that we look back on as significant and fulfilling. If we were to put them all together, it would be a sort of highlight reel of life. These experiences typically happen organically, but we can also pursue new things to try and create them. This is a good idea anyways because [[novelty slows down time]].
