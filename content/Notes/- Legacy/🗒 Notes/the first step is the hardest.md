# the first step is the hardest


In any endeavor in life, the first step is always the hardest. It is always more difficult to start something than to actually do it. 

In The Doorstep Mile, Alastair Humphreys explains that in any adventure, the first mile is always the hardest. It is called this because it is the mile that starts at your doorstep. The phrase "doorstep mile" comes from the Danish "d√∏rstokk mil." The Danes also have the phrase "godt begyndt er halvt fuldendt", which translates roughly to "a good start is half the battle."

The main idea behind this is that starting something tends to be the hardest part. Before we start, we're filled with fear. This comes in many forms, like [[imposter syndrome]] or feeling we're limited by external factors such as time or money. 

If we can just push through this fear, and get through the practical hurdles, we're well on our way to achieving something great. This is obviously crucial if we want to have any chance of [[living our values]].
