As we go through life, there are bound to be sections of it where we find ourself a little bored. Things become sort of stale. Even if we have the most exciting life, [[anything can become monotonous]]. The antidote to this seems to be novelty. 

By changing things up, not only do we increase our [[tolerance for ambiguity]], we make life more interesting and exciting. Often, all we need to spark a little creativity is a change of environment. Since [[we are a function of our environment]], changing things up even just a little makes enough of a difference. 

The power of consistent habits is undoubtedly a superpower we should take advantage of. On the other hand, since [[we don't notice our objective status]], it is important for us to add meaningful changes every so often so we don't slip into autopilot. These add a sense of purpose, urgency, and excitement to our usual routine. We're not doing much different, we're just doing it in a different way. It's redefining what is usually boring into a more meaningful activity.  

One way to inject a sense of change into our routine is with a [[micro-adventure]]. And since it's [[not an adventure until something goes wrong]], this leaves plenty of room for unexpected excitement.
