There are two great mysteries in this life.¬†

  

The first is how we've all convinced each other to go on through life pretending. Pretending we all know why we're here. Pretending we know what's going on. Pretending to care about these ridiculous, mundane, meaningless tasks we've decided as a society are necessary. I mean, come on. We all know how this ends. At the end of the day, none of this matters. You and everyone you care about will die. Time will march carelessly on. The sun will grow until it engulfs the Earth, and the universe will continue to expand into a vast, lifeless void until time itself ceases to mean anything.¬†*(until time unravels.)*

  

The second great mystery is how to properly iron a shirt.¬†

  

And recently, with the concoction of unending hubris and thirst for knowledge that is my personality, I decided to solve that mystery.

  

Technically, I learned how to iron as a kid. My mom taught me. She was busy, as mothers so often are, but she lent her little spare time teaching me lots of important skills. But I was seven and had more important matters to attend to. None of it stuck.

  

My quest to relearn how to iron started as all great escapades do, with a search through random reddit threads regarding the best gear for the job. The search took hours, which is decidedly not an irresponsible amount of time to spend on finding an iron. I am now the proud owner of the Best Iron of 2024. It's pink and shoots steam like a dragon.

  

I'm 18.2% Danish. *(I recently found out through a family history rabbit hole that I'm 18.2% Danish.)* I'm not really sure how such a specific percentage is even possible, but the facts are the facts. I have a strange relationship with my family history. A lot of my ancestry is well documented. There's even a book someone in the family put together about the first generation of American immigrants. But I grew up in the American suburbs, and the half life of my cultural heritage was not strong enough to make it all the way to me, leaving me to research their values for myself.





My Danish ancestors have a concept - "d√∏rstokk mil" - or "doorstep mile." The basic idea is that the hardest part about doing anything is the first bit, the first mile off your doorstep. Maybe it's impostor syndrome or limiting beliefs or external factors. Those are the ones that usually get me. The weird thing is once you push through that first mile, the rest gets a whole lot easier.¬†

  

The first time I used my new dragon iron, I was scared I was going to ruin my shirt. It was a nice shirt that I'd worked hard to buy. I almost backed out entirely. The first mile is always the hardest. But I tempered myself, set the dial to the coldest version of hot that it could possibly be, stretched the cloth across the board, and started.¬†

  

I'd never looked at a shirt in so much detail. I saw each individual fiber woven carefully together. The thread that held the different pieces in place. The texture of the buttons. I thought about all the years of human history that went into it. All the centuries of agricultural knowledge needed to grow the linen, all the effort it took to turn that into fabric, then into something wearable, and then to bring that to the other side of the world so I could buy it. So many people had to come together, resolve their conflicts, and invent impossible machines just so I could have a shirt.

  

Needless to say, my first attempt at ironing was terrible. Firsts usually are. I was a little frustrated that I'd created more wrinkles than I'd smoothed, but I wasn't discouraged.

  

I'm in charge of ironing at our house now. My fiance says it's a man's job. And honestly, I like this work. It gives me a sense of accomplishment. A feeling of taking care of someone. And there are important decisions to be made. How should I set the dials? Hot? Really hot? Should I use steam? These are choices I can handle.¬†

  

This decision to learn how to iron wasn't exactly a thrill seeking endeavor, as you can probably imagine. But I'm on a lifelong quest to learn how to do everything, so I figured having such a basic chore as a blindspot was not helping. And while this wasn't a death defying activity, it did have all the components of a decent adventure. Novelty, challenge, stakes.¬†

  

One of the cruel truths of humanity is that we will always take the path of least resistance, all the while craving a sense of conflict. To be engaged we must be challenged. We always need a problem. But the world is full of difficult problems. Why not let this be one for a bit?

  

There's a certain kind of presence that comes with the focus needed for such a task. Other types of chores don't have this quality. Washing the dishes isn't very engaging. Too easy. But ironing hits the sweet spot. I was thinking about this one time while ironing, about how this task pulls me out of myself and into the present. The possibility of creasing the fabric keeps the mind from wandering. The irony of acknowledging this state of presence forcing its own conclusion is not lost on me. This was not a particularly successful session of wrinkle-busting.

  

And it's not just about clothes, you know. It's a spiritual experience. A brushing up with the elements. Earth, water, fire. It's an interaction with the great polarities. Hot and cold. Yin and Yang. (*A dance of heat and pressure,*) Disorder becomes order. A taming of the unknown, reaching new frontiers with each pass.
  

Often, when I'm not ironing, I find myself sitting, tied to a screen, anxiously aware of the flow of time trickling like water through my fingers as I try to hold onto it. But in the moments with my trusty pink dragon, steam flows up from its source, wrapping me in an impenetrable shield, and time ceases to move. I am no longer haunted by a future that awaits. Not now. I'm too busy for that. For I am he who fights the wrinkles.¬†

  

As you can probably tell by now, I have become a bit of an expert when it comes to irons. My pleats could cut glass. But I have to confess something. Most days, I leave the house wearing a partially wrinkly shirt. It's not that I don't do a good job. It's that I feel too busy to take the time to pull out all the heavy duty equipment. What does it matter anyway? It's just clothes. A wrinkle or two won't kill me.

  

So here I am, again confronted with the first great mystery. At the end of the day, what does it matter? Why go through all of this ironing just to go out and get the shirt wrinkly again? In fact, why make my bed if I'm just going to sleep in it again tonight? Why shower if I'm just going to go get dirty again? The more I pull on this thread, the more ridiculous I feel. Why do anything at all if we're all going to die?

  

This thought looms in my head. I'm not sure why I should bother doing anything. And yet...

  

All of this ironing has me thinking about how we construct meaning in our lives. How we turn a bunch of random events into a story that makes up our identity. How we find purpose in the things that don‚Äôt really matter at the end of the day. I've come to understand that it doesn't come from external factors. It‚Äôs not about what we‚Äôre doing. It's an internal feeling, and so it must come from within. Nothing really makes means anything until we piece it together retrospectively. All the little things we do, the ones that feel so small and insignificant in the moment, get sewn together into what makes up our lives. We become a knotted web of moments and relationships and insignificant actions. Everything is a waste of time unless we decide it isn't.

  

I have no answer for the first great mystery. I do these meaningless things anyways. Things like ironing. I try not to concern myself too much with time scales that don't affect me. The sun swallowing the earth and all that. Because sure, at the end of the day, all of that will happen and maybe nothing will have mattered. But we don‚Äôt live like that, because we don‚Äôt live at the end of the day. We live over the course of many days. And some of those days include ironing. *(We live over the course of many days. Most end with the sun still intact, the universe still indifferent, and my shirt‚Äîdespite everything‚Äîstill wrinkled.)*





















I have no answer for the first great mystery.
At the end of the day, its true, none of this matters. But it's not the end of the day. Not yet.
