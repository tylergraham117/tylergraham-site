# a new productivity and life app

idk what this is yet but it might be cool.







The key differentiator here could be how we weave these features together to create a system that's:

- Personalized to individual patterns

Tracking Methods:
- Auto-detected gaps between tasks
- Manual transition logging
- Smart detection (e.g., moving locations, switching apps)

Analysis:
- Transition patterns by time of day
- Impact on productivity
- Suggestions for reducing transition overhead


### Smart Break System

Break Types:
- Pomodoro (25/5)
