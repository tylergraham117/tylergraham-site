# different ways to play a chord progression

[Really Helpful Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kgH0OFbnyo)


## Held Chords
Just hold the chord until it changes.

Take Me To Church - Hozier

## Quarter Notes
Play the chord in quarters.

Sign Of The Times - Harry Styles

## Quarter + Eighth Notes
Add a note in that plays on eighths.

The Scientist - Coldplay
Imagine - John Lennon

## Arpeggios
Separate the notes in the chord and play them separately.

### Up and Down Arpeggio
Someone Like You - Adele

### Up Arpeggio
Moonlight Sonata - Beethoven

### Down Arpeggio
Clocks - Coldplay

### Others
You can add more notes and with that, more complex patterns.

Prelude in C Major - Bach


## Alberti Bass
Also called a broken chord. (It's a different kind of arpeggio)
Low, top, middle, top.
Piano Sonata in C Major - Mozart

This has a very classical feel to it.


## Tresillo
2 dotted quarter notes followed by a quarter note.
3, 3, 2 in 4/4

All Of Me - John Legend


## Dembow
A variation on Tresillo. 
One hand plays the Tresillo (right?), the other hand plays regular quarter notes.

Dem Bow - Shabba Ranks


## Polyrhythm
Two rhythms playing at the same time.


### 3:2 Poly
"Nice cup of tea" helps you create this rhythm without making your brain explode.

Daydreaming - Radiohead


### 3:4 Poly
"Pass the god damn butter" is the composite rhythm cheat code for this one.

Fake Empire - The National


## Waltz
Really only works in 3/4.
It's a pattern of 3.
One single note, then the other two notes of the chord.
"Oom pah pah"

## Turkish March
Like the Waltz, but the two notes are played thrice.
"Oom pah pah pah"

Turkish March - Mozart


## Staccato Eighths
Short snappy 8th notes.
You can add whole notes under this.
This is a lightweight way to add a chord progression to a complex arrangement.

I Need A Dollar - Aloe Black

## ## Staccato Triplets
Still snappy, but triplets. Typical in Rock and Roll.

You Really Got A Hold On Me - Smokey Robinson
