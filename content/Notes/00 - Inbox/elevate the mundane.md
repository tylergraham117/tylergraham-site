# elevate the mundane

I think we should try to elevate the mundane parts of our lives.

You can use a regular water bottle.
Or you can use a fancy glass from a fancy decanter. 
They cost about the same.

Some people stick with the default, others elevate.

[[we default to the path of least resistance]]

The path of least resistance is usually not the best path.
