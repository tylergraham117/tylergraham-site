# get comfortable with expectation


I've always heard that comparison is the thief of joy, and happiness is reality minus expectation. That makes a lot of sense to me. If we expect something, and it doesn't happen, we're disappointed. If we don't expect it, and it does happen, we're delighted.

To my mind, this is closely related to the Buddhist idea that [[desire is the root of all suffering]].

And here's the thing about me that's important to know. I quite like joy. I'd very much like to be as joyful as possible as often as possible. And if expectation is the thing stealing my joy, then I should try not to have expectations.

For those of you a lot wiser than me, you might see where this is going. But let me tell you anyways just in case.

I've spent much of my adult life trying to temper expectations. And not to brag, but I've gotten pretty good at it. I can enter pretty much any scenario and not be disappointed by what happens. 


If we play this out to it's logical conclusion, then then we should probably eliminate the thief. 






[[the ability to cultivate and verbalize desire is imperative]]
