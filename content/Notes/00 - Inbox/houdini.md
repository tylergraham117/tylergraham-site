# houdini


## Nodes
Nodes are operators. There are a few categories of these.:
- [[OBJ (object, transforms)]]
- [[SOP (surface, geometry)]]
- [[DOP (dynamics, simulation)]]
- [[LOP (lookdev, USD)]]
- [[VOP (vex, shader building)]]
- [[COP (composite, images)]]
- TOP (task, PDG)
- ROP (render, outputs)
- CHOP (channel, motion)


## Nested Network Types

There are two main levels- Object and Stage
At the Object level, every OBJ contains a SOP network. 
At the Stage level, you could put a LOP that references a USD (something on disk), or one that has a SOP network in it, or a LOP with a VOP network inside.

It's a sort of Russian nesting dolls situation. At any level, you always have the ability to put another network inside where you're at. (I guess you can think of this as compound nodes in Resolve color, or as compound clips)

Many tools in Houdini are digital assets with nesting inside. Tools often have multiple layers.
