# how chords work


## I (tonic)
Fully resolved.

## V (dominant)
Most tension possible. The V to I move is the most resolute.

## IV
Feels like a subdued V. Wants to resolve, but not in a rush.

## vi
Almost like an alternate I. Feels sort of like a darker, minor resolution.

## ii
Alternative IV, the minor version. Wants to resolve, but not in a rush.

## iii
A mix between tension and rest. Sort of a middle point.
Could be a resolution point, albeit less satisfying.

## bVII
Outside the key. Feels very open and epic. Opens a new dimension (probably because it's outside the key)

## bIII
Has a blues edge to it.

## bVI
Allows for an unusual turn.

## bII
Exotic, arab-esque sound.

## bV
Unusual, cinematic sound.

## iv
Minor iv is melancholic. Feeling of longing.

## III
Usually wants to go to the IV or the iv.
This is a secondary dominant chord.

## II
Bright, colorful. 
Often resolves to V.

## VI
Wants to move to ii

## VII
Unusual chord. 

## v
Reflective, wistful.
