# how do we rectify idealism and practicality?


If we have beliefs that involve the betterment of society, how do we live properly in the society in which we live?

For example, in the US, we do not have universal healthcare. I hold the belief that everyone should have the right to healthcare, and the government should exist to serve it's citizens. However, although I believe that to be true, I still need to have private health insurance to cover myself. This extends to anything. How do we take care of ourselves while also working to better society?

Does one have to sacrifice their betterment to be the change they wish to see in the world? Probably not, but it often happens.
