# information-action gap

> This idea comes from Sahil Bloom.

The information-action gap is the time between receiving information and acting on that information. 

The highest performing people often have a very small gap between information and action. They receive information and take immediate action on it.

That action can come in different ways. It can be to teach a new insight to someone else to cement what you've learned. You can incorporate that information into existing routines. You can follow up and dig deeper into it. You can reject the new information and not useful. However the action comes, it should be immediate.

If you sit on information for long periods of time, it loses its power.

We should aim to nurture and act upon all new information if we hope to progress in any meaningful way.
