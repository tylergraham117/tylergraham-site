# knives for the kitchen



## Chef Knives / Gyuto

This is the all purpose knife. 

It should be comfortable to hold first and foremost. If you can't hold it comfortably, it's useless. The knife should come from the factory with a reasonably sharp edge. The handle should allow your knuckles to wrap around without hitting the board.

The blade should be thin enough to make good cuts, but not so thin that it will chip. This is a general purpose blade. 
It should also be a wide enough blade so that there is plenty of surface area for scooping and moving food off the board.

Weight is also something to consider. This is preference, but for this we should probably stay in the average range.

Some options:

## Santoku

Santoku's are the Japanese workhorse knife. They are shorter and flatter than chef's knives, which makes them ideal for up and down strokes, as opposed to the rocking and chopping of a bigger chef's knife.

## Nakiri

These are vegetable knives. They're tall and squared off. The blade is straight so the whole blade hits the board at the same time.
