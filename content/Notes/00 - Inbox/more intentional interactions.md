# more intentional interactions


It's easy to let other people take control of a conversation. 

Often, the least socially aware people hijack the group conversation. It's almost the responsibility of everyone else to take it back and add some parameters to the chat.


Other ways of having more intentional interactions involve more interesting questions, or opening up about something you're thinking deeply about.
