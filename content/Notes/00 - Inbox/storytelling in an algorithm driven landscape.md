# storytelling in an algorithm driven landscape


YouTube is based on retention, so your incentive as a video creator is to make sure your audience doesn't leave.

The incentive for a good storyteller and more traditional video maker is sort of the same.

The difference is this: are you trying to make a good, compelling story, or are you relying on cheap tricks to keep the audience engaged.

You can usually tell the difference based on how you feel after watching.

Do you feel inspired and engaged with life through what you just consumed, or do you feel pacified.
