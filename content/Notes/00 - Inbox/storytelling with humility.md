# storytelling with humility


Nothing is more off-putting than a story with a voice that says "I know all these things and you're late to the party, you should know it too."
The audience takes this as if they're doing everything wrong.
Instead, the framing should be that we're going through this together. Not the exact events, but conceptually and emotionally.
They aren't late to the party. The party is for them. 
Consider this as you're writing and telling stories and it will come through in the messaging.


Consider common experiences. Try to talk about how life works without creating a gap between you and the audience.

Look for new ways to bring people into new experiences and ideas.
