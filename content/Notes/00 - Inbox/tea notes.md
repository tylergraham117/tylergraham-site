#### Brewing Vessels

##### Gaiwan
A Gaiwan is basically just a ceramic bowl with a lid.
You put the leaves in the bottom, and then pour the hot water in and use the lid to strain it into a cup.

These are cheap, and great as an entry level way into the world of nice tea beyond the bag.



### Taiwanese


### Japanese Tea




#### Kyusu
