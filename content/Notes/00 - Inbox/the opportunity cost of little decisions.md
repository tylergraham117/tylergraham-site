# the opportunity cost of little decisions

How do we cope with the fact that [[you can do anything, but you can't do everything]]?

[[everything matters]]
[[every second counts]]


When you decide to do something, you're deciding that this thing is worth the time it takes to do that thing. 
You may be deciding that consciously or unconsciously, but it is a decision you're making at the end of the day.

When we make decisions on what is worth our time and what isn't, it's important to consider what we're getting out of that trade.

How do we make that value judgment?

I guess it starts with considering what we value in the first place ([[living our values]], [[clearly defined values]]).
*How do we define what we value?*

I think, especially for those of us living in the western world, our inclination is to value productiveness. That is, how much are we getting out our time in a way that is contributes to the greater economic machine?

The problem with this line of thinking is that it's framing requires us to do things for a result. I know for me personally, this has often lead to a real sense of guilt surrounding free time, leisure, and rest. 

This is even more conflicting because I generally think of myself as someone who enjoys doing things. I like to create things, digitally and physically. I like learning new skills. And I feel like I'm really fulfilled by these acts. But I also wonder if some of that isn't a result of this productivity mindset within the environment I've grown up in.

There's an idea that's really helped me with that. Anytime I feel a pressure towards productivity, I try to think about what it is I'm actually trying to produce. That's the point of productivity in the end isn't it? To produce something?

And sure, lots of time's I'm trying to produce things that contribute to capitalism and in turn make me money. We all have rent to pay. 

But sometimes I want to produce other things. Sometime's I want to produce joy. Or a sense of belonging. Or curiosity.

And the more I use this framing, the more it feels really important to prioritize these different forms of productivity.



*Anyways, that was a ramble that should probably get edited down or out.*



**Some thoughts on solutions / actionable ideas.**
Allow for flexible time.
Allow for long term things to take a long time.
Make decisions based on your values, not values put upon you.
Bias towards novelty. ([[power of novelty]], [[novelty slows down time]])
Flip the frame. Instead of "what am I sacrificing by doing these things", it's "what can I do to get what I want later".
