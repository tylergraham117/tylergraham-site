# things I'd really like to do

Life is short. I like trying new things. 

This is a working list of things I'd like to do in my short time here. 

If you like to help or join me in crossing something off the list, please email me at tyler@tylergraham.io
*(make sure you include which one sparked your curiosity)*


- start a run club
- learn how to be a better storyteller
- get my instrument rating
- 





I try to keep this list short. If it gets to long, it becomes a graveyard of dreams that will never happen. 

I do this in two ways:
- I plan how I will do the thing
- I decide it's probably not the time (those ideas go on the list of [[things I'd like to do one day but not right now]].)
