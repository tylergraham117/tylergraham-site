# This Is the Most Popular Design Style from the Decade You Were Born (article)




## 1920s: Art Deco
The Roaring Twenties was an era of glitz, glamor, and opulence. Art Deco was about more than just decorating. It left a mark on so many visual mediums, from fashion, film, architecture, and interior design. 
Art Deco originally came from the 1925 Paris Exposition, which set the characteristics of the style: Bold colors, geometric patterns, metallics.
Separately, 1925 marked the Bauhaus art and design movements start. It was a stark contrast to the the very detailed look of Art Deco. Instead, it was characterized by metal furniture, stylelessness, and utopianism.
These two styles characterized the decade.

## 1930s: Streamline Moderne
In 1929, the stock market crashed, kicking off the Great Depression. The mentality this produced was that of futurism. "Tomorrow is going to be better than today." 
This design evolution moved away from the grand Art Deco style into something more practical. It swung to the other side of the pendulum, focusing primarily on function. The objects didn't really get reengineered necessarily, but they were restyled and stripped back.
You could see this shift in anything from cars to ships to pencil sharpeners. 
The new style was sleek and aerodynamic. It consisted of curved lines and smooth surfaces.
This streamlining allowed for more affordable, mass produced options. *(Or maybe it was the other way around? They needed cheaper stuff, so they changed design patterns?)*
Russel Wright's "American Modern" furniture line is a great example.

## 1940s: Post-War Modernism
In the 1940s, WWII caused design trends to slow. However, it laid the groundwork for mid-century modern style.
People were still experimenting with the mass market production options from before, but under different circumstances. The Eames' were creating plywood furniture that could be mass produced. Saarinen created the Womb Chair, which influenced design for many years to come.
These new designs largely came from a surplus of materials from the war, like plywood. They were recycled into household items. 
The 1940s also marks the beginning of suburbanization. Post war, people wanted different things. To accommodate demand, the Levittown development in Long Island, NY began. This was the first of many American mass-produced suburbs.

## 1950s: Atomic Age-Inspired
With the introduction of nuclear technology, designers looked to new scientific discovery for inspiration. The atom bomb carried huge cultural influence in the US during this era. The best example of this is the [Nelson Ball Clock](https://store.hermanmiller.com/decor-wall-decor-clocks/nelson-ball-clock/1745.html?cjdata=MXxOfDB8WXww&lang=en_US&cjevent=8617de16aa5911ee82b9f8d40a1cb828). The theory is that this trend was a way of processing these scary wartime motifs through domestication. 
Companies like Herman Miller and Knoll exploded, and some of their pieces (the Eames chair and Womb Chair, for example) reached mass recognition.
Also, technology is a thing now. By 1955, half of American homes had a TV. Because of this, handmade crafts became more common as decor to soften the modernism of technology.

## 1960s: Mid-Century Modern
Space age styles, textures, and bohemian touches. Mid-century modern continues. Very "Jetsons"-esque design takes off because of the space race. 
Plastic becomes a thing. New material for furniture means new design options.

At the same time, a counterculture of psychedelic colors and patterns are starting to become popular. It all begins to mix together.

Minimalist, clean lines. Form and function were prioritized.

## 1970s: Groovy Style
The 70s consisted of trying to bring more natural colors, materials, and objects back. 
The oil crisis of 1973 might've had something to do with people moving away from the petroleum based plastics of the 60s. 
This decade welcomes things like wicker, rattan, macrame planters, and an emphasis on self expression. 
Shag rugs were big. Vibrant shades were everywhere. Busy wallpaper, bamboo/cane headboards, gingham curtains. Very little black or white to offset the color. Just so much color.

## 1980s: Post Modernism (and Pretty Pastels)
There's a deconstructing of the century's former minimalist standard. The 80s marked a time where excessive prints coincided with the Memphis design movement.

Bold primary hues, geometric shapes, unconventional style.
Pastel, desaturated color palettes. Mauve, ochre, and sea foam green.
Maximalism is resurrected. There's anything but white.

## 1990s: Flower Power
Wallpaper was everywhere, especially floral wallpaper. Honestly flowers in general were everywhere, including fake/dried flowers in the home.

## 2000s: Anything Goes
Large furniture. Stone on interior walls. Red, gold, olive green, and dark blue were big. Honey oak cabinetry was everywhere (and still exists in a lot of homes).

## 2010s: Modern Farmhouse
A rustic farmhouse feel. Shiplap walls, industrial wrought iron, barn style beams. Basically just Chip and Joanna Gaines. Grayscale and wood/stone.
