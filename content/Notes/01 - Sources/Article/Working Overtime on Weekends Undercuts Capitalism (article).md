Basically, if you are doing free labor, you're devaluing yourself and your market. 

This is especially important in business and freelance work, but applies to a job as well. You can get ahead in the short term by working more, but eventually you get underpaid and overworked.


Working on weekends is typically thrown around as a useful way to further ones career. I believe this to be true only when you are working to build something you are in control of. Working a job does not count. If you work weekends at a typical 9-5 job, you are donating part of your time to the company, which is in essence devaluing the salary you earn.

On the other side of things, working weekends is also not necessarily a great use of time if you work for yourself. Allowing work to consume every day of ones life encourages an unhealthy mindset. It leads one to believe that productivity and work are the driving forces of ones meaning and value, which are pretty devaluing things to think.
