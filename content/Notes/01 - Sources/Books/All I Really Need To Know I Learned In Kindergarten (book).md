#### Introduction:
- He has an official Storyteller's License. His friend made it up and gave it to him. It gives him permission to use his imagination in rearranging his experience to improve a story, so long as it serves some notion of Truth. [[don't let the facts get in the way of the truth]]
- Storytellers creed:
	- *"I believe that imagination is stronger than knowledge. That myth is more potent than history. That dreams are more powerful than facts. That hopes always triumphs over experience. That laughter is the only cure for grief. And I believe that love is stronger than death."*
- "I have tried very hard not to write anything that would cause my license to be revoked."
