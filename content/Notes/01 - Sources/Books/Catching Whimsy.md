# Catching Whimsy



[[We remember the stories we are told much longer than all the information that comes our way.]] p8
 
It is what we do with the information we amass that says the most about who we really are. When we stop at finding the answers instead of actually doing something with them, we run the risk of getting stuck in an endless cycle of planning that doesn't lead to action. p8

words without application are merely more noise in an already loud room. p9

[[Figure out what you're hoping for, and then get comfortable living in expectation.]] p401

The parable of the lost son follows the parable of the lost sheep and the lost coin. In each of these parables, something is lost in great pain and then is found again with great joy. These are all stories about value and the diligence of the search for the thing of value. p403

[[Make it so that people start assuming every conversation with you will leave them feeling acknowledged and cared for.]] p404
