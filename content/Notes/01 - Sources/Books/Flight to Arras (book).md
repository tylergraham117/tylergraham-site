# Flight to Arras (book)



"No single event can awaken within us a stranger totally unknown to us. To live is to be slowly born. It would be a bit too easy if we could go about borrowing ready-made souls." pg41

Each day we are crafting our future self. I think we all like the imagine that in an emergency, we would rise up and act heroically. In reality, we would probably act how we usually act. We can't just turn into a new person under a new circumstance. Our selves are crafted slowly.
