# Infinite Riches (book)



To hold our interest you must tell us something we believe to be true about the men who once walked the earth. It is the fact about the past that is poetic; just because it really happened, it garners round it all the inscrutable mystery of life and death and time. [[Let the science and research of the historian find the fact, and let his imagination and art make clear its significance.]] - George Macaulay Trevelyan (The Present Position of History)

Don't laugh at a youth for his affectations; he is only trying on one face after another to find his own. - Logan Pearsall Smith
