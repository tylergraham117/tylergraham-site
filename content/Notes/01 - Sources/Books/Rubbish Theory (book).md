### Introduction:
- Traditionally, social economists recognized two main categories of items
	- Transient (Here today, gone tomorrow. Value decreases with time.)
	- Durable (A joy forever. Value increases with time.)
- This book argues a third category, Rubbish. Rubbish is not of positive or negative value, but no value at all.
- If Rubbish was not a category, if everything in the world was of value one way or another, then moving from one category to another would not be possible. 
	- Directionally, Transient is moving in the negative and Durable in the positive. To cross over from Transient to Durable, they must pass 0 (Rubbish, no value).

- The author's supervisor (Mary Douglas) wrote paper called 'Cultural Bias' that was later expanded into a theory called cultural theory. It apparently relates quite a bit to this theory of Rubbish.
- Social status and the ownership of Durables is closely related.
- Money, by itself, does not confer social status. 
	- We can witness 'new money' transform into 'old money' through buying things that make them comfortable, usually Durables. (Among other things)
- Since value is largely a social construct, there is another way. 
	- If a creative and upwardly mobile individual is able to convince the 'high priests' that rubbish items are mis-categorized and are actually neglected components of "Our Glorious Heritage," they become durables.
- We live in not just a society, but a class based society. 
	- Because of class system, we necessitate two critical adjustments in value that are achieved through a combination of making new money old and transforming rubbish into durables:
		- Keeping the value system together as technologies evolve (We can see it start to break down and shift when there are massive technological advances in short time, like the internet. It made people billionaires that definitely wouldn't have been otherwise)
		- Ensuring that status and power are continually realigned. 
- Not just anything can become a durable. 
	- The process has to be restrictive enough as to not inflate the category into not denoting status and power anymore.
	- But also permissive enough to keep the class system active.
- If controls over what becomes a durable high status good is too restrictive, classes become rigid and separated. We shift towards a caste system.
- If controls are too loose, status currency falls apart and means nothing. 
- There are 4 archetypes in the theory:
	- Individualist
		- They do things how they want regardless of what others care about. The artists.
		- Individualist solidarity
	- High Priests
		- These are the critics. The ones that define and decide what's in and what's out. They're the categorizers.
		- Hierarchical solidarity
	- Levelers
		- These are people who flood the Durable category. They diminish both status and power.
		- Upholders of egalitarian solidarity.
	- Losers-Out
		- These people are squeezed out to the margins and are unable to participate in the system.
		- Fatalist solidarity.
- The people who drive the shift from Rubbish to Durable tell us a lot about what the culture values. 
	- It's a dynamic and ever changing system, so this group of people is ever changing too. 
- The value of goods is a socially constructed concept, which means no theory is complete without putting the stuff in the context of people. This theory relies on that.
- "From the crooked timber of humanity no straight thing was ever made." - Kant
	- Nothing in humanity is straight. It's 'curvilinear.'
		- I believe this is referencing the spiral idea
- "Stability is destabilizing" - Hyman Minsky. 
	- This guy predicted the 2007/08 housing crisis but was neglected.
	- This idea falls into the sort of 4th turning model though.
- It seems like all human social systems, whether it be America or a "primitive society" (as the western world would call it), are subject to the same patterns. 
	- Optimistic upturn
	- Confidence starts to ebb away
	- Catastrophic collapse
	- Things start to pick up again
- Greece is a great example. It's one of the oldest civilizations still around, and just recently it almost hit the list of least developed countries in the world.
