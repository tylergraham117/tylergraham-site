# Show Your Work!



### You Don't Have to be a Genius

> [!quote]
> "Scenius doesn't take away from the achievements of those great individuals; it just acknowledges that good work isn't created in a vacuum, and that creativity is always, in some sense, a collaboration, the result of a mind connected to other minds."

Community is an essential part of creativity and coming up with new ideas.



### Be an Amateur
- In French, this word means "lover."
- Amateurs have little to lose, which means they'll try anything and share the results.
- They take chances and experiment and follow their whims. 
- Relates to [[beginner's mind]]
- Not creating anything is much further from good creation that imperfect work is.
- Contributing something is better than nothing.

> "The best way to get started on the path to sharing your work is to think about what you want to learn, and make a commitment to learning it in front of others."

Don't try to teach, try to learn in front of others.


> [!quote]
> Share what you love, and the people who love the same things will find you. Talk about the things you love. Your voice will follow.


- If your work isn't online, it barely exists.
- Read obituaries. You'll find out about the parts of people's lives that matter to those around them.

### Think Process, Not Product
- Artists care more about the process than the product. If they didn't, they'd never get anything done, because the process is 99% of their working life. 
- Share the process rather than the product, it's more content and it's more engaging. People want to see behind the scenes.
- Human beings are interested in other human beings and what other human beings do.

> [!quote]
> "By letting go of our egos and sharing our process, we allow for the possibility of people having an ongoing connection with us and our work, which helps us move more of our product."

Show an authentic, unpolished self and version of your work. It's more relatable than the finished version. Everyone's struggling is ways and that's easier to understand than constant success.



- Document the process! Some ideas of forms in which to do so:
	- Research
	- References
	- Drawings
	- Plans
	- Sketches
	- Interviews
	- Audio
	- Photographs
	- Video
	- Pin boards
	- Journals
	- Drafts
	- Prototypes
	- Demos
	- Diagrams
	- Notes
	- Inspiration
	- Scrapbooks
	- Stories
	- Collections


### Share Something Small Every Day
- The day is a really digestible unit of time. Everyone can understand a day. It has rhythm.
- Share different things depending on where you're at.
	- Early Stages: Share you influences and what's inspiring you.
	- Middle Stages: Share methods or progress.
	- End Stages: Share what you've learned from the process.
- Don't let sharing take precedence over actually working.
- We don't know what is good or bad. Share all of it and see how they react.
- Always ask "SO WHAT?" Is what you're sharing helpful? Is it entertaining?  Interesting?
- Small things get big over time. Don't be afraid to expand on and reuse old material.
- Get a good domain name.


### Open Up Your Cabinet of Curiosities
- Don't hoard your inputs.
- Some practical questions to find ideas to share:
	- Where do you get your inspiration?
	- What sorts of things fill your head?
	- What do you read?
	- Do you subscribe to anything?
	- What sites do you frequent on the internet?
	- What music do you listen to?
	- What movies do you see?
	- Do you look at art?
	- What do you collect?
	- What's inside your scrapbook?
	- What do you hang up or pin over your desk?
	- What do you stick on the fridge?
	- Who's work do you admire?
	- Who do you steal ideas from?
	- Do you have any heroes?
	- Who do you follow online?
	- Who are the practitioners in your field you look up to?
- Share your influences!

- While everyone else is mindlessly consuming, pay very close attention and find the gold in everything. Be aware.

>  "All it takes to uncover hidden gems is a clear eye, an open mind, and a willingness to search for inspiration in places other people aren't willing or able to go." Michel de Montaigne, On Experience (essay)


> [!quote]
> "You have to have the courage to keep loving your garbage, because what makes us unique is the diversity and breadth of our influences, the unique ways in which we mix up the parts of culture others have deemed high and low." 

 
Influences make us unique.



- Don't self edit too much. 
- "Being open and honest about what you like is the best way to connect with people who like those things too."
- The goal is to connect with people that relate to your way of viewing the world.
- Attribution is all about providing context for what you're sharing: 
	- What the work is 
	- Who made it 
	- Why you're sharing it 
	- Why people should care about it 
	- Where people can see more work like it

### Tell Good Stories

> "Work doesn't speak for itself." This is why people don't care about art. 

The art doesn't matter. The perception of the art does. 

> [!quote]
> "Human beings want to know where things came from, how they were made, and who made them."

[[art only matters with context]]

> [!quote]
> "Stories are such a powerful driver of emotional value that their effect on any given object's value can actually be measured objectively." Joshua Glenn and Rob Walker, *Significant Objects*

 If you tie a story to an object, it's objective value increases significantly.

> [!quote]
> "A character wants something, goes after it despite opposition (perhaps including his own doubts), and so arrives at a win, lose, or draw." John Gardner on storytelling.

[[story is a character that wants something and overcomes conflict to get it]]

- Your stories get better with practice, so tell them more.
- Treat interactions with people as "opportunities to connect with somebody by honestly and humbly explaining what it is you do."
- Keep your audience in mind. 
- "Autobiography is only to be trusted when it reveals something disgraceful." George Orwell.
	- Be vulnerable and fallible, because you are.


### Teach What You Know
- "Teaching doesn't mean instant competition. Just because you know the master's technique doesn't mean you're going to be able to emulate it right away."
- Teaching people how to do what you do doesn't mean they'll start doing it, it just means they'll appreciate you more.
- "The minute you learn something, turn around and teach it to others."
	- "Share your reading list. Point to helpful reference materials. Create some tutorials and post them online. Use pictures, words, videos. Take people step-by-step through part of your process."

### Don't Turn Into Human Spam
Balance your input and output. If the scale is between information hoarder and spammer, be in the middle.

> "Make stuff you love and talk about stuff you love and you'll attract people who love that stuff. It's that simple."

- Things we do should give us energy, not drain us. If they don't give us energy, stop doing them. He calls it The Vampire Test.

### Learn To Take A Punch

> [!quote]
> "Fear is often just the imagination taking a wrong turn."

> [!quote]
> "If you spend your whole life avoiding vulnerability, you and your work will never truly connect with other people."

Vulnerability breeds connection. Without it, there is none. Introduce purposeful vulnerability.


### Sell Out
- People will pay if they're getting something out of what you're doing.

> [!quote]
> "I try to be open about my process, connect with my audience, and ask them to support me by buying things I'm selling."

> [!quote]
> "When people are asked to get out their wallets, you find out how much they really value what you do." 

So guard your emotions here.
Keep a mailing list!!!!

> [!quote]
> "You have to be as generous as you can, but selfish enough to get your work done."

### Stick Around

> [!quote]
> "Use the end of one project to light up the next one."

It's important to separate work from the rest of your life. 

> [!quote]
"If you never go to work, you never get to leave work."

> [!quote]
> "Anyone who isn't embarrassed of who they were last year probably isn't learning enough." Alain de Botton

Make room for new ideas by cleaning out the old ones.
You never really start over. The lessons you've learned stick with you and seep into whatever you do next.
