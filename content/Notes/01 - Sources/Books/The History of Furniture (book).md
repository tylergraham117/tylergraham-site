#### Preface:
- The intention of this book is to allow the reader to recognize influences that, in some instances, date back thousands of years. Some of the more important and persistent furniture motifs go back to the earliest days of civilization.
- Three ruling concepts have governed the approach:
	- History
		- The general nature of a particular society for which the furniture was made
	- Style
		- The dominant visual culture that developed and changed as time went on
		- Sequences of styles (Gothic, Renaissance, baroque, etc)
	- Design
		- The way in which components of a particular style, its forms, motifs, and ornaments, were manipulated by craftsmen or designers to produce furniture of character and individuality.
- The traditional use of the word Antique (before the 19th century) meant Greek and Roman and Egyptian architecture and furniture. Everything after that is Modern.
