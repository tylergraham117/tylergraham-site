### Information Dump

##### Chapter 1 - Living on purpose is like wearing horse blinders.
- "Be honest. From time to time we all find ourselves in dangerous places when we think we are safe. Distraction is what leads us into this kind of minefield."
- "Try this: **Take some notes for an entire day on how you are spending time between the big projects or commitments in your life.**" 
	- Pay attention to the little distractions. They add up and have a compounding effect over time.
- "In a word, much of life can leave us feeling completely, inextricably, absolutely, and totally distracted. **When this happens, one of the first casualties is our joy."**
- "Most of us don't want to be told what to do, even when it would be helpful to us. The fact is, we don't need more information; we need more examples. Stay close to a few people who understand how to resist distraction and direct their energy toward their most lasting purposes, and some of this intentionality will rub off on you."
	- We don't need more information, we need examples.
- "If we aren't aware of the alternatives, we won't realize we are settling for less than what is accessible to us."
	- This is why sharing amazing stories is important.
- "We need to block our view of the things that hardly matter at all, stop returning to the patterns that do not serve our larger objectives, start recognizing what is temporary and transitory, and instead focus intensely on the things that will last forever"
	- Like horse blinders
- "More important than the reminder, these songs are declarations of what I'm going to do about my priorities."
	- **Habitually declare priorities each morning.**

##### Chapter 2 - Take care of your heart and grow your mind, and you will live a life loaded with legacy.
- "They would have to stop my freaking heart to help it find a new beat."
	- **It's important to schedule occasional resets to stay on track.**
- "Go be 'one' with the people around you."
- "It's not easy to be your heart, so take care of it, okay?"
- "We will be known for our opinions but remembered for the love we gave to everyone around us. If I have my head down over a project and can't be bothered to shift focus, I'll miss a good chance to show love and grace to the person next to me - and that's not the life I want to live."
	- **Shifting focus from important projects to loving the people around us is a matter of priorities.**
- Take notes on conversations.
	- "Because if I don't, a distraction is almost certain to wipe out any gains I've made."
- "If you'll do the work, taking note of ideas and truths and thoughts that matter to you, you will put yourself in places to impact people in deep and inexplicable ways you couldn't have imagined."
	- "His note taking became a way of harnessing and curating his creativity."
	- **Note taking is a way to think and curate observations of the world.**
	- "Write down all of the lessons you learned from each day."
		- **Think: What did I learn today? From what?**
		- "A life without reflection is like a vapor."
			- Without reflection, life appears for a little while and then vanishes. If we pay attention to it and take note of what's going on, we can preserve it a bit. 
			- Pay attention to the lessons in your life. Write them down. Connect them together.

##### Chapter 3 - The cure for insecurity is being completely present in the expression of your purpose.
- "Going to places that are designed to keep people in doesn't feel natural, but that's exactly why I was compelled to start going."
	- **Do things that feel a little unnatural.** This discomfort leads to growth.
	- It's easy to learn in uncommon places if you go with an open heart and open mind.
- Honesty and vulnerability lead to freedom.
- **"We are not the average of the five most insecure people who have opinions about us; we're the product of the several most focused and undistracted people we successfully imitate."**
	- **Pick a few people you admire and try to adopt their focus and admirable characteristics. Not in a way that sacrifices who you are, but in a way that gives you a clear path towards growth.**
- "Look for virtues, not flaws, in the people around you, and you will find a beautiful path forward in your life."
	- **Look for the virtues in the people around you and tell them when you find them.**
- "Recognize that cynics simply wear their insecurities on their sleeves and subconsciously try to create a low common denominator."
- "What are you doing with your life? Have you drifted from a place that feels like home? Have you demoted yourself from an optimist looking for virtue to a modern cynic? Are you quick to anger and dismay, or do you find silver linings and possibilities everywhere you look? What would it take to begin looking for the virtues in people and circumstances you find yourself in." 
	- **It's easy to slip towards cynicism. How we do stay on track? **
		- How do trams stay on track? They use wheels that don't let them slip. How can we setup a system to make it impossible for us to slip?
- "If you're going to live an undistracted life of immense purpose, it must begin with brutal honesty."

##### Chapter 4 - Distraction can capture your calendar and hijack your happiness.
- "The trick in aviation is to have a quiet cockpit. By that, I mean you need to avoid getting distracted by what is going on outside the cockpit and losing track of what is going on inside."
	- "Quiet down your life if it has become loud."
	- Distractions and noise cloud our judgement and ability to focus.
- "Perhaps we should take a lesson or two from the children around us: **get fully engrossed in something lasting we care about, eliminate some of the decisions we make, and find our joy again**."
- "We start to settle for proximity rather than presence with each other."
- "If we want to live more undistracted lives, we need to get real and admit that busyness is actually hijacking our joy."
	- We can fix this. **Just make an excuse to get people together and focus on connecting. Do things that require your attention so it's really hard to get distracted.**
		- "Get a couple of baseball gloves and talk to your loved ones about your day as you throw the ball around. If you answer your cell phone while playing catch, you'll lose teeth."
- "Figure out how much longer you think you'll live, set a timer to countdown from there, and see how it changes your days. I bet you'll have fewer arguments and scroll social media less... Simply put, your real life will e so good that none of the artificial stuff will distract you anymore."
	- **Make the best choice the easiest one. Make reality more entertaining than your distraction of choice, and you won't get off track.  Make the thing you want to do the most interesting option**, like the author of James Bond.
- "We don't need to hedge our bets against disappointment by keeping our expectations low." Zendaya in Spiderman No Way Home was wrong.
- "**If joy is going on inside of us, everyone will know because it will be expressed outwardly as kindness and caring and action in your life**. You'll be nicer, and trust me when I say this is what the earth needs more of."
- Us versus them is a bad mentality to get stuck in. It's incredibly isolating. There is no them, only us. 
- **Do an audit of how you really spend your time**. Track it throughout the day and see how you're actually spending it.
	- "Ask yourself how much undistracted time you are spending with the ones you love. If you're married, how often are you going deep and practicing authenticity? Shade it in. Don't forget the time you spend pursuing things that give you joy and purpose and encouragement - whether it's reading a book, riding a unicycle, or taking a peaceful walk in the park."
- "**Surround yourself with reminders of who you are and what you want. Set alarms marking the end of one activity and the beginning of full engagement in the next one.** Make a family flag. Put images and symbols that will remind you of what matters most to your family. Raise that flag over your house and your life each day. A flag also helps you tell people what you need. If it's a chocolate cake, put that on a flag and run it up the flagpole. Our friends won't know what we need if we don't signal it to them."
	- I love this practice of having tangible reminders of less tangible ideas. They keep us on track.
	- This passage also touches on signaling what we need to others and making a symbol of what you and your family values, two things that should be outward facing and are incredibly important.
- "You will only be as free as you actually believe you are."
	- **Perception of reality is the only thing that's real in our minds. If you want to be more free, you have to believe you are.**
- "**Write your "Declaration Against Distraction** and then buckle up. You have just created the space for an abundance of joy and purpose to come flooding into your life.
	- This is a great idea. How can I put my values and my hope for the future into a simple declaration?


##### Chapter 5 - Be captivated with purpose and you'll care less about everyone's predictions.
- Most of our failures are not obvious and visible to others, "... and we miss the opportunity to earn people's trust when we aren't courageous enough to get real and transparent about them." 
	- **We have to be willing to share our mistakes. People are fallible. That's a universal truth. People connect with each other on the basis of truths like this. **
