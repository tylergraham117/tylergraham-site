# Figure out what you're hoping for, and then get comfortable living in expectation.
p401



Anticipation is a funny feeling. It's the feeling you get when something is on the horizon. You can't quite see it, but you can feel it. It's a state of being where your imagination runs rampant. There's a feeling in your stomach I can't quite explain, but it feels a little bit like the slow climb on the up end of a rollercoaster. 

I don't feel anticipation often enough. I think as I've become an adult, I do my best to temper expectation. This helps me be okay when things don't go my way. 

The thing about tempering expectation is you temper other things too. Dulling any emotion comes with some accidental side effects. I think with this one, I've taught myself to be just fine when things don't work out. The side effect is that I don't try as hard, and I don't want as deeply. And if [[story is a character that wants something and overcomes conflict to get it]], then not wanting something is lacking any decent story. 

It's okay to want things. It's okay to get excited. It's okay to get let down.

I want to learn to [[get comfortable with expectation]].
