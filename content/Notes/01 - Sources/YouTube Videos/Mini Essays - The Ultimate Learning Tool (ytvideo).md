# Mini Essays - The Ultimate Learning Tool (ytvideo)

Mini essays are short essays, basically the length of a note, that aim to help you truly understand a topic.

The idea is that by taking advantage of the Feynman method, or teaching something to an imaginary other, you solidify your understanding in a more cohesive, long term way.

They are not easy or quick, but they are worth it.

Mini essays also have the benefit of constantly giving you something to write about, which is a big hurdle for almost all writers, especially at the beginning.

You are able to get more reps in and improve as a writer.

Mini essays harness the [[power of novelty]], which keeps things exciting and almost addictive. 

This idea helps you avoid being boxed into a topic.

Gives you a bank of ideas. Insane tool for inspiration.



### What makes up a mini essay?
- Short (100-300 words)
	- One page, within scrolling
- Write them with an audience in mind. 
	- Will they be released?
		- If yes, consider the way these essays will come across. Are they informative, entertaining, actionable?
	- Use this to practice storytelling or prose or whatever else. Let it serve your goals.
- Keep them restricted to a single idea.
	- One core concept. Save the connections and more complicated things for a longer piece of writing.
- The routine of this is important. Make it a habit
