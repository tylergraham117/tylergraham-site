# The design genius of Charles + Ray Eames (video)


- Take you pleasure seriously
- Learn by doing

Kcymaexthaere (don't ask me how to pronounce it) is a fictional parallel reality without our actual reality created by Eames Demetrios, grandchild of Ray and Charles Eames. It's a fascinating concept. They basically put different plaques around the world that mark historical sites that didn't actually occur outside of the fictional world. 

In his talk, he mentions how we [[accept our visual environment as inevitable]], but that is not the case.
