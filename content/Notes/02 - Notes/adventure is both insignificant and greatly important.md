# adventure is both insignificant and greatly important


Why is adventure important?

The concept of adventure is a funny one, because it is, on the surface, quite trivial. We go do something many others have done, or maybe haven't done, but at the end of the day, what's the big deal?

I think the benefits are difficult to quantify, but the feeling of joy and satisfaction derived from adventure, whether that be before or after the adventure, is undeniable. 

The goals of an adventure are arbitrary. It doesn't matter what you do how how you do it. However, if you make rules for an adventure, and fail to follow them, that does matter on some level. These self imposed rules help create structure for the adventure, making it feel more meaningful. Having these rules is entirely arbitrary, so the actual rules you have don't matter. It is important to have them though.

Basically, [[everything is a waste of time unless you decide it isn't]]. So while on the surface it may seem like a waste, that's really only because it's converse to traditional societal values and norms.

I asked ChatGPT to write a script about this.

[INTRO] Hey there, fellow adventurers! Today we're diving into the hilariously absurd concept of adventure. You know, that thing where we go do stuff that other people have done, or maybe haven't, but really, who gives a shit? Buckle up, 'cause this is gonna be one wild ride.

[SECTION 1: THE JOY OF ADVENTURE] So, why do we love adventures so damn much? Well, it's tough to quantify, but there's no denying the pure, unadulterated joy and satisfaction that comes from doing something that makes our heart race. I mean, you ever tried eating Reese's Cups in bed? That's an adventure worth having.

[ANECTODE] Take my buddy Dave, for instance. He decided to go backpacking through Europe. Original, right? Like, no one's ever done that before. But you know what? Dave came back with a newfound appreciation for life and a raging case of athlete's foot. So, who's to say his adventure wasn't worthwhile?

[SECTION 2: THE ARBITRARY RULES OF ADVENTURE] Now, the goals of an adventure are about as arbitrary as my aunt's obsession with collecting ceramic frogs. Seriously, what's the deal with that? Anyway, it doesn't matter what you do or how you do it, but if you set rules for your adventure and then break them, well, then you've got a problem.

Why? Because these self-imposed rules give structure and meaning to our seemingly pointless escapades. But, like, who cares what the rules are? Just have 'em, and you're golden.

[SECTION 3: WASTING TIME IS RELATIVE] Alright, so you might think that all this adventure nonsense is a colossal waste of time. But you know what else is a waste of time? Pretending to work when you're just scrolling through Instagram. _Ahem_ Yeah, I see you, Karen.

Basically, everything is a waste of time unless you decide it isn't. So, what if our thrill-seeking shenanigans go against societal norms? Screw it. Live your life.

[ANECTODE] Remember when I tried to do a handstand on a moving skateboard? On a scale of one to stupid, that was a solid "Why, God, why?" But you know what? That ridiculous stunt made me feel alive. And isn't that what it's all about?

[SECTION 4: CHALLENGING CONVENTIONAL WISDOM] Look, we're all just trying to figure out our place in this crazy world. And maybe going on adventures and challenging the status quo is our way of making sense of it all. Who says you have to follow the rules? Life's too short for that bullshit.

So go ahead, do something completely bonkers. Jump out of a plane, eat a pizza with pineapple on it, or, hell, try to snort a line of wasabi. (Disclaimer: Please don't actually snort wasabi.)

[CALL TO ACTION] In conclusion, my fellow adventurers, I urge you to reconsider your definition of success and what it means to truly live. Take a step back and ask yourself, "Am I really living, or am I just going through the motions?" The answer might surprise you. Now get out there and create your own arbitrary, nonsensical, and totally badass adventures.
