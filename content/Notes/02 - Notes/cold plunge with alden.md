# cold plunge with Alden

### The Story
This year, we moved in with our friend Alden. Him and I both have an affinity for physical challenges that we aren't quite prepared for. Once, we ran a marathon distance on the side of the highway without training, just to see if we could. Recently, it snowed here in Texas. This is a pretty rare occurrence. We decided to take advantage of that. With the scientific research being pretty clear on the benefits of immersing the body into cold water, we decided to take the plunge and jump in the creek. Immediately, our bodies were overwhelmed with cold so intense that we went numb. The cold was pretty much inpercievable, which also means it wasn't that bad. The effect after the fact was an overwhelming feeling of warmth, with energy radiating outwards from within. Our moods were elevated and energy levels were high. 

	This story would probably be better if I went deeper on the pacing I did before the actual plunge. I was super nervous and we spent a really long time preparing to jump in.


### The Point
Things that we think are hard never really turn out to be as difficult as we think. We need to push ourselves to just jump, and then we'll get the benefits of overcoming the obstacle.
