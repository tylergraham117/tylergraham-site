# cutting onions too fast



### The Story
There I was, standing over the cutting board, gripping the knife a bit too tight, racing against the clock. I'd completely lost track of time and now I was in a rush to finish preparing before guests arrived. We all know the feeling. There's an impending deadline, so we kick it up a gear and move with haste. The problem is, when we go faster, technique gets messy. I'm halfway through the last onion when my knife slips. I watch in slow motion as it slices the edge of my thumb. Not quite disconnected, but definitely bloody. I stop and immediately go the sink where I clean the fresh would and bandage it. People start walking in as I wrap up my thumb. Eventually, I get back to work on cooking. In my haste, I made the preparation take even longer. It's like when you're late to work so you speed down the road a little faster than is probably safe, only to get pulled over. Now you have a ticket and you're even later. 
When we're approaching a deadline, it often seems that speeding up is our only option. Instead, I propose we take things as fast as possible without losing control or doing anything dangerous, and then reconsider what led us to be so close to the deadline in the first place. Procrastination? Lack of planning? Lack of awareness? As Jocko Willink says, "Slow is smooth and smooth is fast." Let's try to allow ourselves the proper amount of time to get things done the right way. 


### The Point: 
Slow down to speed up. It's the tortoise and the hare story.
