# don't pet llamas

The point: Everyone is different, and we need to take that into consideration when talking to them.

Some quick llama facts:
They're bigger than you probably think.
They only sleep for about 2 hours a day, max. And they sleep in shifts.
They don't like being pet.

About that last one, most mammals do like being pet. So when I was at the llama castle and learned that, I was pretty surprised. It turns out, unlike most mammals, llamas have pretty short tongues. This means they can't lick their babies to clean them. 

I grew up with dogs, and dogs love being pet. Turns out that characteristic is a byproduct of that lick-to-clean thing 

### The Story

On my 23rd birthday, Jrnie brought me to see some llamas. We drove about an hour, and as we pull into the property, the gates open to reveal a large castle, for the people, and a small castle, for the llamas. The people were pretty eccentric. In front of the castle was a pond with a couple statues nearby, one of a dragon and the other of a horse drawn carriage. We park and head inside. This is where we met the llamas. They had names like "Pajama Llama" and "Barack O Llama" and "Como Te Llama." The folks leading the llama walk went straight into educating us about the animals. Llamas come from Central America, and for a long time most of human's knowledge on llamas was kept in a building in Peru. That building has since burned down, leaving us humans pretty ignorant in the llama department. Much of what we know has been either passed down verbally, or recently rediscovered. There is apparently a lot of misinformation misconceptions about these animals. One fact I found quite interesting was that llamas, as cute and cuddly as they look, do not like to be pet. Most mammals, such as dogs, grow up being cleaned by their mothers via licks. Llamas on the other hand have really short tongues, which makes that impossible. Instead, the way to a llamas heart is food. They're intensely hungry all of the time. I had to constantly fight the urge to pet the llamas. 

In social settings, I find myself often talking to people in the same way, falling into the same groves of conversation that normally talk in. But we can't talk to everyone the same way. People grow up in all different types of circumstances, and it's important for us to keep that in mind when we're communicating. 

	Note: Find a story where the communcation thing is present in your life, then tie these stories together in a bow so the lesson isn't so in your face. Maybe even find some quote that ties things together.
