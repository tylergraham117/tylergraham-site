# double-entry accounting

Double-entry accounting was first invented in the Mercantile era of Europe (specifically Italy around the end of the 13th century). [^1]

It seems like this was the first standardized bookkeeping process. The basic premise is that you track debits and credits in two columns. 

A credit is an entry that increases a liability account or decreases an asset account. 
A debit is the opposite. It is an entry that increases an asset account or decreases a liability account. [^2]

Double-entry accounting is one of the foundational conceptual tools of capitalism.[^3]
