# expectations are the enemy of happiness


I used to think the enemy of happiness is ambition. 

My reasoning was that ambition by definition requires one to desire something different than the situation they currently find themselves in. If we follow that to it's logical root, it's a dissatisfaction with your current state.

And since [[ambition is often driven by comparison]], I thought the curse of ambition was to forever leave us unsatisfied in someway. Therefore, happiness and ambition cannot coexist. 

The problem is that they do coexist, and often.

So now I think differently.

It is not ambitions, but *expectations* which are the enemy of happiness.

Human beings have the spectacular ability to take intentional action. Ambition gives us the chance to aim it. It gives an opportunity to create meaning in our lives.

[[Man's Search For Meaning (book)]]

*Related: We find meaning in the pursuit of what we want, not actually getting it. [[Hero On A Mission (book)]]*

Ambition gives us the opportunity for all three.

By raising ambitions but keeping expectations in check, we avoid attaching our identity to our goals. We want to avoid this because, at least according to Buddhist traditions [[attachment is the root of suffering]]. We allow ourselves to strive for a better life, to accomplish more, and be truly grateful and joyous in the process.

About the next best thing he can bring, and they usually go together, is an appreciative spirit â€” a loving and susceptible heart."

It seems that gratitude and humility bring us a great sense of joy.
