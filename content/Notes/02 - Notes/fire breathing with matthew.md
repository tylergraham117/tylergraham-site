# fire breathing with Matthew

### The Story
I have this friend named Matthew. He's in school to be a petroleum engineer. He spends a lot of time in a lab playing with a bunch of different flammable gasses. As in any lab, there are lots of safety protocols in place to make sure dangerous substances are not coming into contact with with skin. 
During the COVID-19 pandemic, Matthew was tired of being locked up and wanted to learn a new skill. He decided fire breathing was cool. When learning something dangerous, finding the right teacher is important. He found the guy who trains the people in Cirque Du Soleil and decided he was probably qualified, so he sent him and email. A few weeks later, Matthew was on a zoom lesson putting the same flammable gasses he was used to seeing in a lab setting in his mouth so he could look like a dragon. 
The thing is, it wasn't even that dangerous. Matthew knew the risks, but he also how to manage them properly. He knew these gasses down to a molecular level, and he knew the specific environment they had to be in in order to combust. For example, when fire breathing, the gas used will not ignite unless it is vaporized. There has to be enough oxygen molecules between the molecules of the gas for the oil to catch fire, making it impossible for the fire to enter your mouth. 
Matthew explained that in the movies, when they do it with alcohol, it's just movie magic. If you try to fire breath with alcohol in real life, your will set your head on fire. 


### The Point
Everything in life has inherent risk. The only thing we can do is manage that risk. We have to be as well informed as we possibly can, and take calculated risks. Any risk that can be diminished, like the risk of setting your head on fire, should be.
