# flow state


Flow state is a concept originally coined by Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi. It refers to the deep state of focus in which time seems to fall away and you become lost in the present moment. In a flow state, [[focused action leads to presence]]. There is a loss of self-consciousness and ego. This sense of getting out of yourself is crucial to the quality of focus because [[acknowledging presence forces its conclusion]].

Flow state is the result of having a clearly defined goal that is meaningful to you, and is on the edge of what you are capable of.

These criteria aren't surprising. 

It seems like [[most positive emotional states derive from specific desire]]. Having [[the ability to cultivate and verbalize desire is imperative]]. Basically, you need to be able to answer the questions "what do you want?" and "why?" at any given moment.

The meaningful portion is pretty obvious too. I remember being in high school going through various state mandated courses and often hearing the phrases "why do I need to know this?" or "how is this going to help me in the real world?" These questions are actually crucial, and not understanding the importance made it really hard to learn. Conversely, [[understanding the importance of something is a crucial part of learning]].

It's also no surprise that we have to be on the edge of our abilities, because [[we must be challenged to be engaged]]. 


Flow cannot be forced, in the same way presence cannot be forced, because [[acknowledging presence forces its conclusion]]. The two are in the same vein. Although you cannot cause flow directly, you can create the [[conditions of flow]]. These are those:
