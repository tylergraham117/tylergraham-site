# input controls output


Throughout our lives, we are almost constantly in a state of input. It is important to be conscious and intentional about that input, as our input controls what we are able to output pretty directly. 

If we want more unique outputs, we need to adjust out inputs, because [[uniqueness comes from our influences]]. 

[[we are a function of our environment]]
