### The Story

When I was a kid, my parents bought me a little plastic push lawnmower. It didn't cut grass very well, or even at all, but it did have these little plastic balls inside that shot around like crazy when I pushed it. I used my lawnmower to help my dad cut the grass. When he got out the big mower, I would follow behind him with my little one. My dad loved when I helped him mow the lawn, and I loved it too. But my dad knew my mower cut exactly 0 blades of grass. So why did he want my help? Sometimes, the act of being with someone is all the help you need. It's not about what you're doing, it's about who you're doing it with.

### The Point
Spending your time with someone is one of the most giving things you can do. It's memorable, and it's the only resource we have that is truly limited with no alternative sources. It's important to remember to include people in things. The goal isn't always to get things done as efficiently as possible. Sometimes the goals is to do things with people, to cultivate a small community around an action. 

This story is ironic to me now, in my young adult life, because I have sort of made it a personality trait to be morally opposed to lawns. 
Lawns are bad and it does matter. While the story of togetherness is heartwarming, we can reach an even deeper sense of togetherness by returning the space in which we practice being with each other to a more natural state, full of biodiversity and life. When we return life to the areas we've made void of it, not only can we connect with each other, but to humanity as a whole.
