# my dad always used to tell me "don't force it"


### The Story
You know how people have reoccurring dreams sometimes? I think we also have reoccurring memories. I view these as memories that pile on top of each other because they have a similar theme. 

Here's an example. When I was a kid, I had this habit of taking things apart to try and see what was going on. It was a curiosity that I think my parents tried hard to instill in me. Most of the time I'd have a hard time putting it back together. I'd work at it for a while, and eventually get frustrated and start jamming back together. My dad would repeat a phrase that likely echos down from generations before him between father and son. "Don't force it." It was a reminder to take a step back and think about what I was doing instead of just brute forcing my way through the problem. It was a much more effective way to get done what I was trying to do.  


### The Point
When facing a problem, it's important to slow down and reassess possible solutions. Forcing things often lead to a worse problem than before.
