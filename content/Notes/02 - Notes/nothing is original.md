# nothing is original



Recognizing that nothing is truly original is imperative to any creative endeavor. Since [[creativity is the processes of creating connections]], we have to be willing to draw on preexisting ideas in order to get anything done.

By understanding this, we free ourselves from the notion that we can't say or do anything that's been done before. It lets us out of the creative prison we trap ourselves in.

> "If we're free from the burden of trying to be completely original, we can stop trying to make something out of nothing, and we can embrace influence instead of running away from it." [[Steal Like An Artist (book)]]

 When reading, go into the references and follow the line of research or inspiration. You can do this with anything.
In order to learn a subject or a discipline, learn about specific people and follow their tree of influences.

I like this term creative lineage. The whole "family tree of influences" idea is really interesting. We have lines through history that connect us to the past, not only by blood but by thoughts, art, and other forms of influence.

I've never really been able to articulate why, but I feel that this is important as well. It's like a physical manifestation of my curiosities. It's inspiring to know how much is out there to learn, and it helps keep the ego in check when I start to think I know what I'm talking about.

I love this. It's helpful with overcoming imposter syndrome. It's reassuring to know that this is a common thought, and that even though something's been said before, it's still important to repeat and say in a new way.
