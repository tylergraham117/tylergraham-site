# salon dinners

I first heard about this in a Tim Ferris podcast with Sam Corcos. His company [[levels is building in public]]. He also makes some other things public, which are in that link.


Here, he outlines his process for hosting salon dinners: [How to Host Salon Dinners](https://levelshealth.notion.site/How-to-Host-Salon-Dinners-66d235f4a3394b7bbdef0a7bedf29af5)
As well as some topics they've used/plan on using: [Salon Schedule - Google Docs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Py--2QYnzMNLg_rjFmXv0G0h6jGXWxfCqVOYXBU774A/edit#heading=h.bazt4ji6xpvg)

This is definitely something I'd like to do at some point.

Apparently, this isn't a new thing.
[Salon (gathering) - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salon_(gathering))
> "The salon first appeared in Italy in the 16th century, then flourished in France throughout the 17th and 18th centuries. It continued to flourish in Italy throughout the 19th century."
