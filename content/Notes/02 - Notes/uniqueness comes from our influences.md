# uniqueness comes from our influences


[[we are a function of our environment]]. 
If we want to become more unique, we need to craft ourselves a more unique environment, because uniqueness comes from a unique combination of influences. Our [[input controls output]]. If we make a habit of seeking out less common things, we get flooded with new ideas, because [[diversity drives progress]].

Van Neistat is often referred to as incredibly unique, but he really just uses the styles of others that are less common. His influences are different.
