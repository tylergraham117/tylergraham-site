# we are a function of our environment


People have an incredible ability to adapt to their environment. Because of this, we have a tendency to become whatever our environment shapes us into.

This effect can probably attributed [[cognitive dissonance]] or something very similar to it. 

Since we become what our environment shapes us into, it's important to make sure that our environment is in alignment with our [[clearly defined values]], so that we can be sure we are [[living our values]]. 

We are a byproduct of our inputs. Our immediate environment has a clear impact on us, as our senses are constantly bombarded with whatever is in our environment. It should be obvious, then, that our environment should be tailored for whatever emotional state we wish to have in that space.

It's important to be careful of what we let in. What we allow to be influential to us becomes a part of our identity, however small. In a way, we need to be aspirational about our inputs. In this way, [[we are the culmination of our experiences]]. 


We are a direct byproduct of our immediate environment and how we perceive it. Our senses are constantly bombarded with whatever is around us. It should be obvious, then, that our environment should be tailored for whatever we wish to accomplish in that space.

To be more creative, we have to make sure the things that inspire us are pushing us in the right direction.

In a similar way, [[our tools shape what we create]].
