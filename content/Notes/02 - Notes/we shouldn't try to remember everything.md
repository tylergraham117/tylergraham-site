# we shouldn't try to remember everything
[[Remember (book)]]

It is important to be conscious and picky about what sorts of things we choose to remember, as we only have so much room to store things in our brains.

Just like we have to practice [[conscious consumerism]] with what we bring into our lives, we have to be conscious of what we let into our minds as well, because [[we are a function of our environment]].

There are people who don't forget so easily. This group of people are diagnosed with something called hyperthymesia. Or HSAM ([[highly superior autobiographical memory]]). These people remember everything in vivid detail, to the point of it being harmful. It makes function in everyday life hard.

If we did try to remember everything, the process of remembering would become all consuming. If you try to remember everything in your life, you'll be too busy to live life and create new memories. You'll be living almost entirely in the past. In addition, if you spend every moment recording what is happening presently, you'll forget to experience the actual beauty of life. Is in everything, [[balance is the key]].
