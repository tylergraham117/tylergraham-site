# writing is thinking

What is thinking? Is it the constant stream of consciousness flowing through your mind? Or Is it when you sit down to brainstorm?

Well it turns out it's complicated, and thinking is both of those and lots of other things too. 

A common way the types of thinking are categorized are [[system 1 and system 2 thinking]]. This is the core idea of the popular Daniel Kahneman book, [[Thinking, Fast and Slow (book)]].

The idea is this: 
System 1 thinking is near instantaneous, happens automatic, and is driven by instinct and experiences. 
System 2 is slower, requires more effort, and is more conscious and logical.

So what do we mean when we say writing is thinking? Mainly two things.

The first is that writing is a way of expressing system one thoughts. When we write, we allow things in our heads to come out. 

The second is that, by writing, we are forced to look more closely at our ideas. To shift into system two thinking. It is only then we are able to decide if something is an accurate representation of what we believe. 

Writing also allows us to make connections between ideas that we normally might not make. By connecting ideas, we are able to flex our creativity muscle, because [[creativity is the processes of creating connections]]. Writing makes that difficult thing a bit easier.

The process of writing forces us to [[make the unconscious conscious]], which helps us develop a deeper understanding of the subject we're writing about in the same way that [[teaching helps us learn]].
