# Music Index

Music is one of humanities oldest art forms. It's somehow inherent to our nature. And yet, we've turned it into an industry, into something that must be learned through years and commercialized. It's fallen largely into the trap of [[making hobbies into professions]]. Why do we do this?

I'm trying to learn music because it's a form of communicating with other people through emotions directly, not just through words. It's a deeper form of communication. There's so much humanity in music.

Mostly I'm learning keyboard, so that I can play any digital instrument in [[Logic Pro]].

This [[piano fundamentals (book)]] seems like a promising way to learn.
