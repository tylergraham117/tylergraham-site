# for those of us sleepwalking through life



*EXT. Standing in a field holding a compass up. Long zoom into it.*
This is a compass.
You know compasses. 

They have the directions and the little red arrow. 
I used to keep one on my desk. 

I thought it was a nice reminder to keep our true north in mind and not lose sight of what we're after. 

But not anymore. No no no.
Because it turns out, we've been lied to. For years, big compass has led us to believe that if you want to get to the north pole you just follow the red arrow. 

Turns out, it's not that simple.

*Bulletin board with extensive research.*
And I've been working hard to uncover the lies and, frankly, bamboozlement's that we've all been fed.

*Show Santa and a magnet. Point to the santa one.*
The first one is that North isn't even really north. There's 2 norths. There's true north, and there's magnetic north. That's the one compasses point to. But I want to go here.


The second lie is that magnetic north is a moving target. Something to do with magnetic fields. It's not very fast, just a few miles a year, but it moves. Right now it's on it's way to Siberia.

Now, as you might imagine, finding this out was pretty earth shattering. 

So I got grabbed my compass and I put it where I put everything I don't want to see or think about anymore. 
*Put compass in a box that says "WARNING. or DANGER or something"*

And while I was getting rid of that trash, I saw something else. *Journal labelled "Strong Beliefs: Things that are 100% true. Do not question. Do not open."*

I don't know about you, but I don't really like being told what to do. 
(Open the journal. I get sucked in.)

*There's a bunch of words just floating around. They're a bunch of beliefs I hold*

As I walked around, I found a bunch of old beliefs I hadn't thought about in a while. Some really pivotal, some less so. 
*Show some serious and some clearly not.*

Lot's of them were things I learned when I was younger. 

One really stuck out to me.
*I walk over to a belief labelled "Expectations lead to disappointment." I reach out to touch it, and suddenly I'm flashed back into my desk reading some stoicism.*

In my late teens, I found a concept that really resonated with me. It was called Stoicism. 






I didn't really put things into real practice. I just read second hand accounts of things and pretended that I knew what I was talking about.
And maybe to an extent, I did. But I think I fundamentally misunderstood some of these ideas.










[[The word happiness would lose its meaning if it were not balanced by sadness.]]



I read somewhere recently that we should figure out what you're hoping for, and then get comfortable living in expectation.





I haven't exactly figured this out yet.

But I have learnt something. Check this out.
This is the type of map we use when we're flight planning. It's got these little lines here that tell you exactly how much magnetic deviation a compass has depending on where you are. And the people that make this map, along with some help from big compass, update this thing all the time so you can know exactly where north is before you hop in a plane. 

Maybe these things aren't so bad after all. Just have to make sure we understand it all the way and update things every once in a while. 











### Scratch Notes:



The way I'm thinking about this now is a little different. 
It's still true that expectations can lead to disappointment.
But I think it's also true that expectations lead to anticipation and excitement, and ultimately is the thing that drives us to act on our ideas and desires. 








How do we create a full circle ending from this to make it more satisfying?
End with a couple solutions that are kind of out of the box and not so serious.
Then go to "The truth is I haven't figured this out."









This is a compass. You know compasses, right? They've got the arrow and all the different directions. 

Here's the thing with compasses. They're not exactly perfect. I learned from flight school that compasses will have a deviation of a few degrees depending on what you're doing in the plane. If you're speeding up or slowing down or turning, the compass will temporarily guide you in the wrong direction. For example, if you're turning from a North heading, the compass will temporarily indicate the opposite direction.

And that's not a huge deal as long as you know about it.



I keep a compass on my desk. And its not for cardinal directions. I have no idea which way east is. 
We're all carrying around compasses - guidance that worked for past versions of ourselves but might be pointing us in the wrong direction now.





This is teaching me that the old version of myself needed that advice. But the current version of me probably needs a different piece of advice. As we grow, it's easy to let old lessons guide our steps. I'm trying to reevaluate those old lessons and make sure they're giving me the right heading.





Taking a backseat in life. Maybe I can do this literally.




[[get comfortable with expectation]]

The video version:
- Brag about how good I am at not getting excited about things, sarcastically obviously.
- Give a specific example of how I’m trying to change this
	- Christmas morning is the obvious and timely one. What else could there be?
	- Proposing
- It’s the stuff we get really nervous about. 
- 

There is also the option of following the story of wanting something, losing it, and finding it again.


If you feel like you’re Sleepwalking through life.

for those of us sleepwalking through life


What is expectation? 
When’s the last time you felt anticipation?




What's the five second moment?
This is the moment of change. How do I illustrate the change?

Well, the change is this:
I used to think it was important to not have expectations. I thought being in anticipation was awkward and uncomfortable and expectations led to unhappiness and should be avoided.

Now, I realize that those are important emotions and have a role in driving our desires and leading us towards taking meaningful action.

I don't know if there's a specific moment I realized this. Sometimes, this just change in your subconscious without you really noticing. But recently I checked this belief and realized I don't actually agree with it anymore. 




Jamais Vu. The opposite of Deja vu. The feeling of experiencing something you've experienced before in a new and novel way.
How can we approach everyday things in a slightly different way that gives a sense 













This all started in flight school. 
I was working hard to undo the years of brainrot that living with a phone had done to me as I relearned how to use a paper map instead of a GPS. And then my instructor said to me, "you know, compasses aren't always 100% accurate. They have errors and it's time you know what they are."

I was shocked. He went on to explain the various deviations compasses had. Probably. I don't really know. I wasn't listening. I was somewhere else, thinking about all the 







End on setting the compass down next to a big magnet and then remove the magnet. 
Sometimes it's worth checking the things surrounding our beliefs before throwing out the whole idea in general.








[[Expectation is how you hope things will turn out. Anticipation is different. It is for people whose resting position is leaning forward.]]
