# how to make your own sound effects for video


sound designing a video with objects i already own




*INT. Overhead*
It's no secret that, when it comes to video, sound matters.

*Cuts to different things making sound on my desk. Speaker thumping, lamp buzzing, typing, tapping pen.*
Without it, 
*Start muting tracks that are floating in front of me. Sounds leave and so do the objects. Eventually the whole video disappears and I'm in basically a void.*
a video just starts to feel a bit empty.


I recently saw a comment on on an instagram reel between some of my favorite creators. 

*Show comment from Sky to Mapal about making a sfx pack from fuji.*

Now, I haven't seen that pack come out yet, and I have one of those cameras. So I guess I'll just do it myself.

*Throw camera towards screen, stops in front and floats. Then, match cut it to different situations. End on a cut that leads into a motion control shot of me sitting down and starting the next talking head. B point still has the camera in frame, out of focus.*



So here's what I'm thinking.

I want to create that sound effects pack, but what if we push it a step further?

Instead of stopping with just a folder of clicks sounds, which is already really useful on it's own, I want to see if we can sound design an entire scene using nothing but sounds we get from this x100vi. 

We'll start with the easy sounds, and get progressively more advanced with our techniques as we go on.

And hopefully by the end of it, we have a well designed soundscape and, more importantly, a nice little sound pack that we can reuse in the future.



Now we're obviously going to need some sort of visual to sound design, so let's just redo the intro to this video. 
*Maybe switch this*
To get started, let's take the intro to this video and rebuild its sound design, this time using only sounds we record ourselves.






#### Level 1
iPhone microphone. No processing. Just use some basic clicks for this.

And now in Resolve, we can start to layout some of these sounds. 

It can be temping to just jump right in and start placing sounds wherever it feels good. But I think this is a perfect time to take a step back.

So lets mute our speech and music tracks and just look at what we have here. I'm looking for anything could theoretically make sound. I'm also thinking about what might be just off screen or hidden that could also be making sounds.

Now since we have a pretty limited selection, we're going to go for the obvious ones first.

Clicks are the best sound to convey an immediate change. If you have a cut you want to emphasize or an animation that pops on screen, these are the perfect places for click sounds.

Let's do a quick play through with everything together.

And it sounds okay. It's not amazing yet but we have a start.

The main thing I want to to express here is that you can just record stuff. 
You don't have to do anything fancy, or have expensive subscriptions, or know any of the intense techniques we're going to cover later in this video. You can just record sounds at any point throughout your day with your phone and find a place for them later.

Sound is everywhere and free for the taking. 



#### Level 2
**Expanding the Soundscape**

a theory of sound design

When I'm approaching a new sound design project, I try and envision the soundscape. 
*Circle/eye forms. Zoom out into black void. Sound visualizer appears.*
A soundscape is the acoustic version of a landscape. It's the combination of every sound you can hear in a given place. 
Maybe its wind and birds and a creek and insects.
Maybe its traffic and air conditioning units on top of buildings and the footsteps of people walking.

When I think about sound for video specifically, I like to break it up into different categories. 

*Show list*
Speech
Ambient, Atmosphere
Foley, SFX
Music, Score

*Maybe do a little seesaw thing?*
The process of creating balance between these categories and the sounds within them is called mixing, and it is a crucial step. But this isn't a video about mixing, so we're just going zoom in on these two categories. (Ambient, Atmosphere & Foley, SFX)

Ambient and Atmosphere is where you build the emotional base of your sound design. It's also where can you create your soundscape.


We can also introduce things like drones to give emotional depth to the atmosphere we're creating. 
Music will a lot of times play this part as well depending on the project, so sometime the lines between these categories get a little blurry.

*Zoom back in to the list.*
Foley and SFX are all about shaping where the viewers attention should be. 
They are the main sounds that lay on top of your ambient and atmosphere.
This is where the clicks we recorded land.

You can think about foley as trying to recreate what sounds would naturally occur in a video, while SFX are more about adding icing on the cake.
For example, foley could be typing on the keyboard, while clicks and whooshes would be a SFX.

Having these categories in mind as you sound design really helps you keep a mental checklist of what you need to add in. 

At this stage, we're also going to introduce rerecording those sounds we got before with a more professional setup. This way, we're able to have a little more control over our sounds, and we can capture some of the more subtle details.

Now none of the sounds we're recording here really make sense for creating ambients, but they're fantastic for the SFX category.

*Put some more sounds into the timeline*

Our audio is getting fuller now, but it's feeling a little shallow. Let's make it more dynamic.


#### Level 3
**Creating Shape**
More complicated processing. Start stacking sounds.
Layer multiple sounds for complexity.
Pan things.


What is sound?
From a physics perspective, it's a wave moving through a medium. We can visualize these waves through a handful of really useful tools.

The one most people are familiar with is the basic waveform. This is a visual representation of the frequency and amplitude of the wave. Or put another way, loudness over time.

Another helpful one to understand is a frequency spectrum. This helps you understand the different frequencies a sound exists at.

A spectrogram shows all of this at once, but they can be pretty complicated to look at.

Using these tools isn't strictly necessary, but I've found that the more you look at them, the more you start to understand sound and how you might want to shape it to get the result you're looking for. 

We have a lot of our sounds placed into the timeline already, but it's feeling a little two dimensional. Let's try and make it more dynamic by shaping that wave.




The way I think about dynamics in sound design is through volume, depth and width.

Depth comes from layers. Sound layering is additive. You're hearing the sum of everything playing at a given time. Because of this, mixing two sounds together creates something slightly new. (give example)

Width comes from taking advantage of stereo audio. Obviously this is dependent on the audience having headphones or speakers, but it's worth doing anyways. If we have a set of sounds layered together, we can widen the soundscape with a little panning. That slight contrasts makes it so much more dynamic.

psychoacousticsâ€”how layering affects perception


Another thing I do on a lot of my sounds is just a quick EQ. This isn't like EQ-ing a voice where I need to analyze the harsh frequencies or anything. Most of the time, it's just a low pass (cutting out the high end) or a high pass (cutting out the bottom.) *give examples*
If a sound feels harsh or like its sticking out, a quick EQ does so much to blend it in.

Sometimes, I'll have spent a while finding the perfect sound for a visual, just to realize I need another one. And sure, I could just reuse the same one, but repetition is boring and the audience's subconscious will pick up on it.
In this situation, I recorded the sounds myself, so I have as many as I want. But that's not always the case. So one thing I like to do to add just a little bit of variety is change the pitch of the sound ever so slightly. You can also change the speed of the sound, which unless otherwise stated in the software will also change the pitch. 



#### Level 4
**Bending Sound to Your Will**
Introduce processing and animation.
Change pitch for variation.
Reverse sounds for risers.

We've spend our time so far recording sounds and finding where they best fit in our footage as they exist naturally. It's sort of like playing with legos. We're putting the pieces together.

But sound isn't rigid like a lego. It's malleable. 

So instead of using pre-made lego bricks, let's see if we can start to make some bricks of our own.

Processing audio can mean a lot of things. Most softwares have some basic tools listen by default, but when you start going through the effects you start to realize how many different ways sound can be shaped.

Here are some of the ones I use most often. 




Some of these sounds feel like they were recording in a studio for a video. They're too clinical. Sounds in the real world aren't just the sound. It's the sound and how it interacts with it's environment. To give a sound that quality, we can add a reverb. I like to go really subtle with this. It's easy for it to start to sound fake. 
Dry is the source audio, wet is what the effect is creating. 


Here, I'd like to put a riser to build some anticipation. Unfortunately the Fuji X100vi cannot make riser sounds.

So this'll have to do. In order to turn it into a riser, we'll just ..

Basically anything can turn into a riser.


*Introduce automation somehow*





#### Level 5
Dedicated DAW.
Switch to logic. Start getting really complicated.

Sound designing in a video editing software is great. It's convenient and does the job. 
But in the spirit of pushing this experiment further, let switch to a dedicated audio software. This is, frankly, overkill for a youtube video. But it's fun and I want to see how far we can push these sounds. 








#### Bonus Level 6
Remake 360.








Maybe we just make it 3 levels.



iPhone SFX

Pro Mic in resolve

Dedicated DAW




























Sound design a scene at varying levels of difficulty all from the Fuji.

1.  iPhone mic, normal clicks. No processing.
2. Minimal processing. (Pitch, reverse sounds)
3. Extensive processing. (Layering, )
4. Using Logic to process sounds.
5. Music.






What is sound?
It's a pressure wave of air captured by a little capsule. The design part is how we shape it. 

That was the inspiration for the camera breaking the sound barrier shot, but I'm getting ahead of myself. 


Physics
In a physical sense, sound is a wave moving through a medium. Usually that's air, but it can be other things.
