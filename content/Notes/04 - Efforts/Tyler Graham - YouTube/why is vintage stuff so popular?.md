# why is vintage stuff so popular?




how does old stuff become cool?



## Script

#### Intro
*INT. NIGHT*
*Walk into locked off frame. Turn on light, lighting up my face.*
*Grab a VCR from the mess on my desk. POV follow it to the TV. Put it in.*
*Slow push in on CRT TV. Eventually, we enter the TV as it starts playing.*


*(On the TV. Typing on a typewriter at my desk. This is the thumbnail shot.)* 
You've probably already noticed, but old stuff is trendy.
*As I say trendy, reset typewriter. On the bell, it cuts, but the word "VINTAGE?" stays on screen. Then we go into a sequence of showing old things that are popular.*


I first noticed this trend of vintage in the world of fashion.
But it quickly started popping up in more and more places. 
Interior design, advertising, YouTube.

Everyone in the creative industries seem to be moving in the same direction.


*Cut to me on my phone. Crash zoom as I look up, then look at camera*
And at first I thought this was just the typical cyclical nature of trends that we see throughout the years.

However. I keep noticing it in more and more places. And I'm starting to think something else is going on.

So, I did some digging. 

*Intro sequence into title*




*Start on black. VO comes in. On "new tech," fast montage sequence of new technologies coming out. Music is a fast, futuristic type beat. Text on "Every Single Day"*

**VO**
It feels like new technology is coming out every single day. There's always some ground breaking discovery. A new thing to learn. 
As this happens, I find myself more and more gravitating towards the past. I just find it more comforting and I'm not really sure why.

*INT. WI Camera looking through books. Pull out book to reveal.*
**To camera**
And I don't like not knowing why. 

**VO**
So I started with reading about how trends evolve. I found research papers. Books. 

And that's when I realized...

*INT. Med center framing*
**To camera**
This is going to be more work than I thought.

*CU: Quick cuts on different lighting setups to show time pass. Build chaos.*
**VO**
I read about old thrift shops, the creation of value from trash, design trends from the last 100 years, and Macklemore??
*INT. WI Top down shot. Sitting on the floor. Papers surrounding me.*
*I look up and throw some papers. Camera tracks up through the roof, up to map, over to London.*

**VO**
The research was getting overwhelming, so I decided to simplify my approach and start with figuring out where the idea of vintage comes from.


#### The Emergence of Vintage

**VO**
And that brings us to London. In the 1960s. 
*London, warp into historical imagery, buildings pop.*

It turns out that the idea of vintage is a product of the industrial revolution allowing factories to create mass prod...

*Cursor goes to close video. Track on cursor. Zoom out to show youtube*
Wait wait wait. I know history is like boring or whatever but I promise this is important. Just bear with me.

*Zoom back in*

The industrial revolution allowed factories to create mass produced consumer goods. Before that, clothing was really expensive.

Now that factory made clothing is widely available and relatively cheap, secondhand clothing becomes associated with poverty.

**Transition talking head**

And in this weird social status game that everyones playing, wearing clothes that are associated with being poor isn't cool, so people stop wearing used clothes. [^1]

*Back to historical graphic*
**VO**
That is until the 1960s in London. 

Around this time, the UK is undergoing a shift in taste at home.

*Found media*

People are starting to appreciate the the historical significance that their homes have. And with that, they begin to look away from all the shiny new home decor on the market, and instead develop a sort of "alternative consumerism." [^2]

*Text "alternative consumerism"*

*Zoom over to markets*

Over the next couple of decades, these things called rag markets start popping up. They're mostly a way for people to make extra money selling clothes during the recession. It's a side hustle. [^1]

**To camera**

But there's also a rebellious aspect to it. At this point in Britain there's a new emphasis on 'natural' products and a general move away from typical consumerism.

I even saw one article that referred to the way certain young people dressed at the time as "outlaw fashion" which I thought was kinda sick.
*Source animated*

**VO**

So wearing vintage clothing comes out of an inherently anti-consumerism cultural movement.

But over time, the line between high fashion and street style starts to get fuzzy. 

And the idea of wearing old clothes starts to become accepted. (Great Gatsby, American Graffiti, Annie Hall, China Syndrome)

*Map to NYC with vintage wave moving over*
Eventually, this idea makes it's way out of London, across the ocean, and into New York City.

At this point, vintage is still pretty niche, and the articles about it at the time seem to be kind of mocking it,

*(“old,” “vintage” and even “laughable.” Taylor’s tone is one of amusement) pg 54*
 
 but that starts to shift in the 70s. 
*"the beginning of a new fashion era" - from the 70s part of the paper*

Wearing old clothing starts to become mainstream. People are raiding the vintage boutiques and consignment shops and thrift stores. 

**To camera**
*Standing*
Because of this shift, the media at the time decided to ask people why they preferred old clothes over shopping new.

And from what I can tell, there are really 5 main reasons:

*Graphic. 5 boxes or whatever, start unfilled.*

The price. I mean, this one feels pretty obvious. Second hand stuff is usually cheaper than buying new stuff. 

The originality. If you buy something vintage, you can be pretty sure that you're not going to run into someone else that has the same thing as you. It makes your thing seem rare, and you're the person that had to work hard to find the thing. It's almost a different kind of status symbol.

The Experience. Buying new things usually happens in a big box store or online. That's boring. Buying vintage comes with the experience of finding it. 

Quality. Because of the transition into mass production, the quality that larger companies are able to produce drops dramatically. So people turn towards older materials, older techniques, to get something of high quality. 

Authenticity. This one is pretty esoteric but it seems to me that this is just a sense of human-ness. Mass production and large scale consumerism feels really robotic, so by looking towards small shops selling objects of the past, you're able to connect to something real. 


*INT Med* 
**To camera**
Honestly, coming up with this list felt like I'd figured it out. These are the reasons why old stuff is popular.

And, like, yeah.

But then I started to notice something weird with one of the reasons. Price.


*Cut to a bunch of expensive old stuff. This sequence should feel like a build / chaotic and then a release on a nice clean minimal shot of objects*

**VO**
Not all old stuff is cheaper. It turns out that some of it is a lot more expensive.

*Jump cuts on those minimal product shots*

#### The Creation and Destruction of Value

*Title of section comes up*

When I think about the value of an object, I'm tempted to think about that thing's intrinsic, empirical value. 

*B Roll of people interacting with old objects would be cool here.*

But in reality, objects don't really have intrinsic value. The value of an object only really lies in how a person or lots of people interact with that object. 

Value is constructed socially, through collective beliefs.

And an object can be worth a lot, and then slowly decline in importance until it is all but forgotten, and then emerge from the ashes as more valuable than ever before.

But how?


**To Camera**
Over the past couple years, there has been a massive resurgence in the popularity of film.
*Show film resurgence*
There was a point when film was a technological marvel.
*Historical sources*
Kodak was the most popular film company. In the 90s they were  one of the most valuable brands in the US.[^4]
[Kodak Failed By Asking The Wrong Marketing Question](https://www.forbes.com/sites/avidan/2012/01/23/kodak-failed-by-asking-the-wrong-marketing-question/#:~:text=In%20fact%2C%20at%20its%20peak%2C%20Kodak%20captured,its%20success%2C%20which%20made%20it%20resistant%20to)

["The last Kodak moment?"](http://www.economist.com/node/21542796). _[The Economist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Economist "The Economist")_. January 14, 2012

*Early digital films*
When digital came around, slowly, most people transitioned. It was a new technology that made a worthy replacement.

Eventually, film became basically worthless outside of really specific uses. With digital being easier and cheaper, there was just no reason to use it.

**To camera**
Recently though, and if you're anywhere close to the video production or photography space then you already are very aware of this: people are using it anyways. 

So much so that the price of film has gone way up. So has the resale market of old film cameras. 

We're even seeing companies produce new film or film emulation technologies to bring us this nostalgic feeling. (Fuij x100vi and Kodak Super 8)

**To camera**
The point I'm trying to make is that in, I don't know, 2017, the demand for film cameras was really small. To most people, it basically didn't exist anymore. 

But today, it seems like everyone's trying to capture the essence of film. 

Just like the people in the UK during the 60s that started caring about their architectural history, or the people shopping at thrift stores in 1970s NYC, we've identified there's something magic about film.

This technology has regained its value in the marketplace because the artistic look that is popular right now drove it there.


So how does something make that journey? 
To go from basically trash to something everyone seems to care about?


*Throw something in the trash.*


Let's talk about Rubbish Theory.

Rubbish is something we pretty much ignore. It's discarded from our lives and therefore our minds. It generally lives outside of the concerns of economic theory. 

But some objects, although pretty rarely, re-enter the value circulation as a prized possession.

Here's how it happens.

Objects are broken down into 3 groups: transient, durable, and rubbish. 

The value of a Transient object decreases with time. It's value is trending negative. This is most objects.

The value of a Durable object increases with time. It's value is trending positive.
The ownership of Durable objects is closely related to social status. So people want Durable objects.


Rubbish is different. It has no value. It's value is 0, and it is not moving.


But every once in a while we see an object go from a downward trend, from Transient, to a positive trend, Durable. 

According to Rubbish Theory, the only way something can go from a negative trend to a positive one is by passing 0 first. For a Transient object to become a Durable, it must first become Rubbish.

Remember the film example.

Not just anything can make this move from Transient to Rubbish to Durable. The Durable category is associated with status, so naturally it has some gate keepers. 

Rubbish Theory calls these the "High Priests." They are the critics, the ones who decide what's in and what's out.

The other archetypes of the theory are: 
The Levelers: These are the people who flood the Durable category and diminish both status and power.
The Losers Out: These people are squeezed out to the margins and are mostly unable to participate in this system. 
And finally, the Individualists: These people do things how they want regardless of what other people care about. 

The Individualists tend to be the champions of Rubbish. They are the ones that move these objects into the Durables category.



The types of people that are able to make the shift from Rubbish to Durable are representative of our culture's values. 
Right now, we seem at least partially to be valuing people who find importance in reusing old things, in not wasting, in vintage.

They value quality over mass production. They value originality and nostalgia and experience and authenticity. 


I like to think of the Individualists as the artists. 


There's constant pull on us as creatives. It's a pull to shift our creative preferences towards whatever new wave of creative material is becoming popular. 

But you can't catch a wave as it's already going by you. 

I've spent this video talking about trends and cycles and the creation of value. 

But it seems like the ones who are actually able to move the needle in any meaningful way are the one's that don't really care about all of that. 


The concept of vintage isn't about the quality or the deals or anything like that.
It's about the human storyline, and where we fall within it.
It's about a connection to our past. 
It's the feeling of being part of a greater narrative.

The real discovery here for me is that instead of chasing trends, we should aim to create them. 

Rather than following the direction of the crowd, we should aim to stick with the direction that feels true to ourselves.

That's how we aid in creation of value. If not economic value, artistic value. Human value.

That sounds simple enough. But the world fights against us in this. We are bombarded by the opinions and desires of others which pull our attention away from our own.

"It is easy in the world to live after the world's opinion; it is easy in solitude to live after our own; but the great {person} is {one} who in the midst of the crowd keeps with perfect sweetness the independence of solitude." Ralph Waldo Emerson, Self Reliance.






People are rebelling against a future they do not want by going to the past.


Maybe I also talk about how old things are time machines. By having access




I need to pause our video here for a second to be transparent with you. I've been working on this script on and off for months. And so far, it's felt like I just can't make it work. I thought maybe I hadn't done enough research, so I started doing more. I thought the story wasn't interesting, so I spent hours writing new drafts. Eventually, I started to think this idea wasn't interesting at all. 

Then one day, Jrnie brought home a cassette player. She had been at her grandmas house all day going through old dust covered boxes full of memories. And that reminded me of the old dust covered tapes that I had at my parents house sitting in my childhood dresser. 

So I went and got them. 

When you start going through memories like this, you can never be too sure what you're going to find. 

Past lives begin to unfold right in front of your eyes. 

*Play a tape of Nana.*



There are a lot of reasons people long for the past. 

In my drive to find out why, I've been looking at it from a lot of different angles. I thought if I took an academic approach, if I looked at the history and the economics, I would find my answer. 

And I wasn't wrong in that. But it's incomplete. 

When I think about why I'm drawn to old things, it's not because trends or economic value or anything like that.

It's because these things tell stories. Stories about me and where I came from. Stories about the people I love. Stories about people I have never and will never meet. 



???^
This clinging to the past feels safe. It feels like home. I'm scared of the world we're building. It feels like it's moving in a direction that sterilizes human-ness. 













#### Act 2: How Trends Trend

##### 1920s
We begin in the 1920s. 

The second industrial revolution just wrapped up, which means huge advances in metals and electricity and transportation and, most relevant to this video, mass production.

Factories are able to just pump out product. Up until recently though, there's been a little bit of an elephant in the room gobbling up all the factory space.

But now World War 1 is over and factories are able to shift from weapons manufacturing to consumer goods. 

~~And although the economy was pretty rough during the war, it explodes afterwards.~~ 

The period was characterized by leisure and luxury for the most amount of people in a like most of history up until that point.

Movies become an American pass time. Almost half of American households have radios. All this economic prosperity is giving people the extra energy to be creative. So Jazz.

~~More women are working than ever before in American history because all the dudes got drafted. But now they're back and are ready to work, but lots of women want to keep working, because money, so they do. And this brings them more economic independence than ever before. And so what do they do with it?
They cut their hair and wear scandalous dresses all the way up to their knees. *GASP*~~

~~Men are dressing in lighter colored suits, representative of the lighter time they're now living in.~~

~~And this seems to be a theme throughout, actually. ~~

After WWI, there was this general sense of celebration and being done with war forever because it was fought at such a large scale. It was an optimistic time and the future was bright. 

Which explains art deco. I mean look at this. Bold colors, geometric patterns, metallic finishes. 
A lot of this is influenced by the technology of the time. We turn trains and cars into a very streamlined aesthetic in our homes.

We've got refrigerators. We've got vacuum cleaners. We've got washing machines. Screw doing chores by hand, it's party time. How are we going to pay for all this stuff? 
Credit cards! 



*Newspaper about the stock market crash spins onto screen.*
##### 1930s
Oh.

So the 30s are weird. It's this huge contrast from the previous decade. 
It was the longest and most severe economic downfall ever experienced by the industrialized Western world. Economics are complicated and not really part of this video, but basically this is the worst situation America has been in since like the Civil War.

In the world of design, there was this mentality of futurism. They looked towards a better future, mostly because the present kinda sucked.

People couldn't really afford to buy things like they did in the 20s. So instead of engineering new products, there was a sort of stripping down of existing design that happened. A version of minimalism emerged out of necessity. 

Designs were streamlined, which made them easier to mass produce, which made them cheaper and more accessible. You can see this in everything from cars to dishes. 

~~The 30s were also the golden age of radio because it was cheap entertainment. So we see a lot of living rooms arranged around a central radio cabinet instead of all facing each other, kind of like how it is today with TVs.~~

~~The world of fashion kinda kept innovating. ~~

~~But it was mostly found in the celebrity world. The silver screen became a beacon of hope for a struggling society. ~~

If the 20s were a time of excess, the 30s were a time of, um, not excess. 
*Holding a thesaurus*
Moderation? Restraint? Lack? Insufficiency? 

##### 1940s
So like remember how we fought in that big war? And then like we had this whole decade characterized by celebrating that war was over? Well...

Basically all of America's resources are going to fighting again. Instead of making cheap plates and furniture, factories have to shift to making tanks and bullets and fighter planes.

Design kinda takes a beat here.

But the war ends in '45 and there's this huge economic expansion. ~~Wait isn't that what happened last time a war ended? That's probably not important.~~

~~Anyways so everyone's coming back from the war, and now they want to buy houses and start families. So residential real estate demand just explodes, and builders have to find shortcuts to keep up. 
*Welcome to the suburbs* (Levittown)
Mostly this just means cheap materials and small houses. (around 1000sqft)
They also would just like leave part of the house for the homeowner to finish??
Which is where unfinished basements come from.~~

All the factories stop making weapons again, but it takes a while for them to retool (equip a factory with new or adapted tools.). 

The late 40s and 50s sort of bleed into each other a little bit because of this post war lag, but eventually we start to see a huge shift in design and consumer behavior.

##### 1950s
During the 50s, the United States is an absolute powerhouse. Wages soar and unemployment falls. To most, the Great Depression is a distant memory, and everyone just wants cars and furniture and houses and kids. So many kids. 

The suburbs continue to develop and begin to get connected by highway systems.

Rooms get painting in these bright happy colors.

There's also this weird thing where the atom bomb carries this insane cultural influence? So instead of being real about how horrible it was they just kind of processed these scary wartime things through atomic-inspired design? I don't know man. Looks cool though.

~~Open floors plans attempt to bring the outside in, and technology advances a bunch. 
By 1955, around half of American homes have a TV.~~

~~So~~ to balance out all of the modernism in design, lots of people used handmade crafts as decor.

Oh! Space! Space Race era technology was hugely influential on the design trends of the time. We see these motifs on everything. Clocks, lamps, upholstery, all over the place. 

It's a lot like how the design trends of the 20s were driven by transportation technologies like cars and trains, except now its space ships.

##### 1960s
The 60s sees a continuation of mid century modern design, but there's a counterculture blossoming. 

We see this huge rise in individualism now that time has passed since the war.

The youths are rebelling against tradition and America is changing.
~~We've got the civil rights movement, women's right's movement, these dudes. (the Beatles)~~

Everything in design from fashion to home decor gets more dynamic and colorful.
~~There's a playfulness in it.~~

All these boomers are being born families want bigger houses to accommodate them. 

~~Economic prosperity is driving trends, so things like matching furniture become a status symbol. It showed you that you could afford to buy a whole room full of furniture all at the same time.~~

##### 1970s
In the 70s, people want to bring more natural colors and materials into the home. House plants become a big thing, and so do things like wicker, rattan, and macrame.

~~There's also like this big oil crisis that had people waiting in line for gas. 
That probably had something to do with people not using as many colorful plastics as in the 60s.~~

There's shaggy rugs, busy wallpaper, and very little black or white. Just so. much. color. And disco!

There's also soaring inflation. 

But instead of looking to the future like they did back in the great depression, American's fell out of love with machines and instead this started romanticizing the past and nature. 

##### 1980s
Minimalism is all but dead by the 80s. The underlying theme of design as a whole is excess. Bright colors are back and house plants are sent back outside. 

There's a sense of affluence and optimism.

There are lots of dual income households by this point. 

We also see the invention of the computer, which also means a new type of design:
Digital Graphic design. We see those same bold colors here too. 

It's a vibrant decade.





And I'm actually going to pause here for a second. 

Because from around the 60s on, American culture gets more and more fragmented.

It's not just one overarching culture. It's a culture and a counterculture. And then it's subcultures of those, and subcultures of those. 

As communication gets easier, people find other people that they connect with on increasingly niche interests. And the internet just accelerates that in a way that makes things really difficult to track.


***BREAK***


In addition, these historical summaries are just that: summaries. They leave out a lot of the story.

Like lets rewind to the 20s for a sec. 
Now when I was taught about the Roaring Twenties in school, they made it sound like it was just one big Great Gatsby party for like 10 years straight.
And maybe that's true for some people?

But what doesn't really get talked about is the wealth shift that occurred over the course of that decade. 
Towards the end of the 20s, the wealthiest 1 percent of people were receiving nearly 1/4 of all pretax income. 

Check these out.

[Economic Inequality - Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/economic-inequality#all-charts)

This is a chart that shows us how much income the richest 1% of people are making in the 1920s. It ranges from 20-23% throughout the decade. 

60% of families earned less than $2000 per year. That's like trying to feed your family on around $30k in 2024 money.  ([Roaring Twenties | Definition, Music, History, & Facts | Britannica](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Roaring-Twenties))

Later, like in the 50s and 60s, the top 1% are have a lesser share. Somewhere between 12 and 16%.

Here's that same chart flipped upside down. This is the income share of the bottom 50%. 

In the 20s, it's about 13-14%. The top 1% make more money that the bottom 50%.

In the 50s and 60s, again we see that shift, and we're pushing 20%. The bottom half of income earners now have more than the top 1%. Barely.


Why are we talking about wealth inequality in a video about the popularity of vintage? 


When things become popular, they also become more valuable. Very basic supply and demand. 

And if things are valuable, it costs money to buy them. If people don't have money to buy the popular thing, they'll find a different thing.

So what we see is, depending on who has money, and how much of it, different types of things become popular.





Let me give you some concrete examples that align with the timeline we just went through.

First let's look from the early 1900s up until 1929 when the stock market crashed.
Even though the 20s were supposedly this massive party era where everyone was doing great, most people were not doing great. There was reform and fundamentalism and crime and debates of alcohol prohibition and political corruption. It was a time of "do what feels good" as the people's vision for the future darkened and worldviews grew increasingly complex. 

The Stock market crash of 1929 kicked off the Great Depression. Times are tough. People are preoccupied by real, tangible struggle. It's a period defined by a sense of urgency to fix the world. 
There's not a lot of philosophical, spiritual exploration going on. It's time of pragmatism. Eventually, societal feelings transition to exhaustion, then relief, then optimism. 

Which kicks off the next stage around when WW2 ends. Society is unified having just gone through tough times and fought a common enemy. The perspective of what the future could become gets brighter. 
This is when we see tradition American suburbs start to pop up everywhere. The vision for the American dream as we understand it today seems to have been born during this era. And we've been fantasizing about this high since it happened. 

We shift towards again around 1964. Society is getting comfortable and forgetting about the trials they just went through. We see rising individualism and spiritual exploration. Think like Woodstock.

Then finally, in the mid 80s, we shift again. National debt is growing, we see the same wealth gaps emerge as we did in the 20s, and the vision for the future grows darker once again.


The time in which a generation is raised shapes their values for the rest of their life. 

So we see a situation where current events shape the young generation of the time. As they grow, they become able to shape the environment in a way that reflects the values they've learned. And the way they shape the world impacts the climate of the society that future generations are raised in.

That tends to lead young generations to hold opposite values from their elders. 


> *(Source for this whole section is The Fourth Turning)*



When we overlap design trends with all of this, we see that here are periods of relative economic prosperity and innovation but also a sort of 'ignoring the problems' mentality that usually comes with loud maximalist designs and flashy consumer goods. 

Then there's some sort of economic downturn, which is followed a pulling back on the consumer side. Design gets a lot more minimalist out of necessity. 

And then something happens, a lot of times a war, that makes things even worse for a little while, but eventually stimulates economic growth in some way that brings us back to a more prosperous state.

People begin getting comfortable innovating with design again. And the cycle continues.






Basically, trends seem to be driven by a 3 main things.

The first is economic status at a societal level.
The prime example of this is minimalism vs maximalism. 
Generally speaking, when the economy is performing worse, minimalism is more popular. When it's doing well, maximalism starts to be more popular.

The 20s were a hugely maximalist decade, as was the mid century era.
The 30s were more minimalist, largely due to the great depression.

If times are tough and people can't afford expensive things, then cheaper things get made, and design has to follow that. If the economics allow it, then design gets to experiment and innovate.

Which brings us to the second driver, technological innovation. From trains and factories to space ships and computers, the technology of a time largely impacts how people interact with their environments. It also provides a set of constraints that design has to exist within.

The final driver is that the youths want to rebel against their parents. Basically every decade is characterized by people looking at the last generation and being like, man, you guys did a bad job.
And they do the exact opposite. But when every generation does the exact opposite, trends end up swinging like a pendulum. 

Every time there's a trend, there's a reaction. 
Most reactions are in some way the opposite of what came before them. 
So trends have this natural swing back and forth. 















#### New Ideas




I've been focusing on the history and the facts about this. But I should pivot to talking about how it personally impacts me. And how to be the Individualist / Artist is able to make things valuable regardless of norms.


It's a video about how people have the power to make things interesting through how they use it.




How would Shaffer make this video?
He'd probably try and connect it to something unrelated, because [[creativity is the processes of creating connections]]. 

There also would probably be some sort of action in real life, away from digital land. Which makes sense. That's kind of the whole point of the vintage movement anyways.

But what?

Maybe I could talk to some people about vintage? Or maybe 










There's this pull for us as creatives, as artists. It's a pull to shift our creative preferences towards whatever new wave of creative material is becoming popular. 

But you can't catch a wave as it's already going by you. 

So basically we should just be worried about creating things that we think are awesome and not worry about what's "popular".





The real idea here is that instead of chasing trends, we should aim to create them. That's the creation of value. If not economic value, artistic value.
This is a reminder to myself to be more focused on creating style that chasing one.










## Scratch Pad


I could incorporate my personal interactions with vintage.
- Working at ACO, not understanding why certain things were being thrown out.



Vintage isn't even about the quality or the deals or anything like that.
It's about the human storyline, and where we fall within it.
It's about connection to the human condition.
It's the feeling of being part of a greater narrative.






- How do class differences impact the trend cycle?





The types of people that are able to make the shift from rubbish to durable tell us a lot about the qualities our culture values at the time. Since all of these statues valuations are social constructs, the people who we allow to decide what becomes valuable, or Durable, are sort of representative of the culture's values. 
Right now, we seem to be valuing artists who find importance in reusing old things, in not wasting. They value quality of mass production. And this is representative of a shift in our culture. We are moving away from being a wasteful, mass produced society and towards one of care and intention. At least I hope that's what this means.








With the way the economic environment is now, it's a desire for the security and stability of the past that this generation has never known.

	- People that spend the most money on keeping up with the Jones's are usually uncertain in themselves.

Trends seem to trickle down throughout all design, starting in the areas that have the quickest realization process. 
Fashion is relatively quick to go from design to product, so you'll see those trends move faster than something like interior design or architecture. 
But the trends trickle throughout.
