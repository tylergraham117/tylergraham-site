### Idea Dump
- Make a boat. Peak experiences.
- Benefits of novelty.

**Structure this whole video like the heroes journey. Inciting incidents push us into a meaningful life. We can manufacture those with adventures, and build the habit of living a meaningful life.**


[[adventure is both insignificant and greatly important]]
[[everything is a waste of time unless you decide it isn't]]

Your life is a series of moments. Moments governed by what you pay attention to. 
	- Moments make days, days make weeks, weeks years, a lifetime. (So a good life is a collection of these)
	- We need to fill the carousel with moments that are important to us.
- Build an old fashion projector from that book and fill it with moments. We need to live in a way that fills this thing up.
- Life is simply a collection of moments, and it's our responsibility to make those moments meaningful. 

- How to make your life more interesting
- How to have an interesting life
- Do more cool stuff
- Why your life is boring
- Why life feels boring

- Life being interesting or boring is an entirely internal thing.
- Who are interesting people? What do they do?
- If you want to be interesting, be interested
- Curiosity is the antidote to a boring life
	- What has this done in the past?
- If something gets hard, don't get mad, get curious.
- Curiosity requires humility.
- Life can't always be interesting. It ebbs and flows.
- If someone is excited about something, it's really easy for them to get me excited about it. Excitement is contagious.
- Hedonic Treadmill
- Novelty
- What does the day to day experience look like to the happiest people on earth?
- We don't need to think of life as a highlight reel. The boring days can matter just as much, and they deserve just as big of a spot on our Carousel and the massive highlight moments do. 
- Life is kind of supposed to be boring a lot of the times
- We often live for the future possibility of living a good life, but life is right now. We have to life for that life. 
	- Procrastination makes life boring. Do the thing now. Take an action.
-  Do something you're proud of everyday. 
- Make stuff for yourself. You'll feel accomplished and proud each time you use or see it.
- Boredom is simply a failure to pay attention (from Sam Harris app). 



Lately, life has felt a bit dull. There's nothing wrong, necessarily, but I've noticed a certain lack of spark I've come accustom to. It's been lacking something adventurous. 

I'm doing this to try and shift that. I'm nervous about doing it because it'll be a little sketch.

I feel like I'm generally pretty good at identifying internal problems and fixing them over time, but if that's true, why do these sorts of problems keep coming up? Maybe I'm not as good at this as a think?

### Old Ideas

I'll build a boat or raft entirely out of reclaimed materials. I will not buy anything. I will then row or sail this boat across lake lavon.

Discuss ideas of adventuring locally.

Humans become inherently bored of their surroundings. When our senses get used to something, they are less stimulated by them.

I see this in my dog too, she tends to get bored of walking around the block but is on high alert when it comes to new places.

General Story Structure

INTRO

"There's this lake near my house. Growing up, my family would come here all the time, so I know the area pretty well.

This is me in my workshop where I build things sometimes.

Life has this weird tendency to get stagnant sometimes. I feel like if I'm not consistently experiencing intermittent changes, I get pretty dissatisfied. My usual remedy for this is to try something big or go somewhere new, but that can be really expensive or time consuming. And with the way of the world recently, sometimes that can be nearly impossible.

So what I've been thinking about recently is what if I could get a similar effect without going anywhere fancy?

What if we could add a little bit of adventure and excitement into our normal everyday lives?

I'm going to build a boat out of scraps and reclaimed materials I find around town or in this garage, and then I'm going to get across this lake. That's about 5 miles.

Let's get to work.



SEARCHING FOR MATERIALS

I'm not sure exactly what I'll be able to find so I'm going to look around town for things that look seem and then design the boat around that. I saw this cool Russian guy build a kayak out of plastic wrap and sticks a while back, so I think that's a good place to start.

Finding things

This whole wacky idea came from this idea I've been exploring recently about how we can implement adventure into the places we live. It's easy to think that adventure is this really far away and expensive thing when we look online and see all these insanely beautiful locations, but I think with the state of the world right now it's forced people to get a little more creative closer to home.

More supplies

There's this concept in psychology known as a peak experience. It can be defined as

"...a highly valued experience which is characterized by such intensity of perception, depth of feeling, or sense of profound significance as to cause it to stand out, in the subject's mind, in more or less permanent contrast to the experiences that surround it in time and space."

(Leach, "Meaning and Correlates of Peak Experience," 1962)

Abraham Maslow was the first to describe this concept. You probably remember him from this poster in your high school health class.

Peak experiences tend to be times that we look back on as extremely significant and fulfilling, and may even have a level of spirituality to them. These are the big moments in life, kind of like a highlight reel.

Typically these experiences happen organically. What I'm wondering is if I can engineer a peak experience close to home, practically for free.



DESIGNING THE BOAT

~draw out some sort of plan.



CONSTRUCTION

Begin building the boat

You know how when you walk into a room and it smells weird, at first you're like 'man whats that smell?' but then over time the smell becomes normal and you don't think it's weird anymore? The smell hasn't gone away. If someone else walks into the room, they're going to notice it and make the same scrunched up face you made. But you're used to it, so you don't notice. This can be helpful with bad smells, but it's a shame that it happens to us regarding our lives and the beauty we see in them. We get so used to where we live and what we do that it loses its shine and just starts to feel normal.

It’s not necessarily a bad thing, we can be really committed to  and fulfilled by long term things, and these things take consistent work every day. But what I want to do is take that idea and see if I can't smash it together with this idea of peak experiences. Obviously if I went on this grand expedition, I'd create this type of experience I'm looking for. But that's not the point. I don't think that creating an experience like this necessarily requires the big time or financial investment we're trained to believe it does.

It's really an exercise in appreciating the things we already have access to.

REFLECTION

This whole concept of peak experiences has a lot of similarities to the idea of 'flow,' where the mind tends to have increased performance in learning, focus, artistic creativity, and loads of other things.

This can be super useful if you're feeling stuck in a rut or just kind of bored with the day to day of life.
