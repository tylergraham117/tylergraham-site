# how big companies trick you into thinking they're small

[[Vintage, the First 40 Years (paper)]]
## Vintage Clothing's Authenticity versus Mass Production
- "Objects and experiences deemed authentic are often associated with nature, tradition, heritage, the pat, craft, originality, and reflecting one's core identity." 
- Customers eventually become dissatisfied with goods and services in and of themselves. Instead, they expect companies to cultivate compelling experiences. This is described as the 'experience economy'. (Gilmore and Pine, 2007)
- Because of the desire for authentic, experience focused brands, companies start to put a marketing focus on 'authenticity claims' that attempt to obscure the industrial processes involved in manufacturing things. 
	- This is like when corporations use small family owned imagery.
		- Think Trader Joe's or like a wine company emphasizing 'family tradition.'
- In clothing and likely other industries, the distinctions consumers make about what is 'authentic' and what is not is often based in falsehood. It serves to make us feel better and give us a sense of moral superiority about purchasing less industrialized products when we buy vintage, but it was probably almost just as industrialized. 
	- For example, even today, most clothing is technically made by a person at a sewing machine. There's just a much smaller focus on quality and a higher focus on low cost and quantity than there was before.
- In post-war society, attention to design became paramount. There was a sort of aestheticization of everyday life.
- The authenticity of vintage clothing is socially constructed by the people that wear it. They decide which styles of the past constitute a 'genuine' signification of a particular decade.
- Vintage appears to be craft because of the way it's displayed in todays boutiques in small quantities, implying a limited supply and production. In reality, they were probably quite standardized when they were made, but the copies that once hung next to it on the store rack are long gone now.
	- Perceived scarcity.
- Nostalgia, in the context of vintage, takes on multiple meanings.
	- Idealization of the past
	- Justifiable appreciation of the quality of past production methods.
- The experience of shopping vintage is much more engaging than department stores, and way more engaging than the online shopping of today. Less convenient for sure, but it's not always about convenience. It's not like we're going to the thrift store for toothpaste.
