# the secret to motivation that lasts
**or**
# how to stay motivated



This is the intro to the mantra series. 

Motivation is fleeting. It doesn't last long. But every once in a while we hear a phrase or an idea that sticks with a little longer than usual. To hold onto that, I write them down. 
And this is great when I revisit the list, but it would be better to display them in areas that I see all the time. Areas where it makes sense for them to be. 


"Excitement is a better motivator than discipline. The people who appear to have an exceptional work ethic or remarkable discipline are often those with a genuine curiosity or interest in that area. The person who smiles is more likely to keep working than the person gritting their teeth."
James Clear newsletter

##### Description
Motivation is fleeting. It doesn't usually last long. But every once in a while we hear a phrase or an idea that sticks with a little longer than usual. To hold onto that feeling, I write them down. Then, I revisit them over and over and over again. They're called mantras, and I think they're really helpful. I hope you give it a shot and benefit from the ideas I share in this video!

~ Time Capsule ~
I haven't made a video in (almost) an entire year. Lot's of life stuff has happened in between.
My career has gone in a couple different directions, mostly through experimenting with different opportunities. I'm hoping not to take another year to make the next video. 
I've gotten engaged, which is INSANELY COOL and so special and I feel blessed for the opportunity to spend my life with such an incredible individual.
I've travelled and learned a lot in lots of different areas of my life, and I can't wait to share

##### Intro
INT. Reading book / phone, gets inspired, then deflates.

VO.
*Have you ever seen or heard or read something that just stirs up this fire inside you?*

*You feel inspired and like you can conquer the world.*

*For about 5 minutes. Then its back to normal.*

CUT TO: Blurry shot of me building? Or hanging it up?
*But what if we could bottle that feeling up?*


##### Extrinsic vs Intrinsic Motivation
CUT TO: Atomic Habits closing

*I want to get something out of the way right from the beginning. This is not a video about habits.*


CUT TO: Talking Head
*The way I see it, there are two different kinds of motivation. Extrinsic and intrinsic.*
CUT TO: Making coffee. Drinking it. Doing something. Stumbling. Sleeping.
*Extrinsic relies on something outside of our control.
But anytime we rely on something external to get us moving, we're doomed to fail.*
CUT TO: Motivational video playing on the laptop
*This is why people are so obsessed with self discipline instead of motivation.*

CUT TO: Talking Head
*And I agree with all of that. Self discipline and forming healthy habits are clearly the winners when it comes to building the life you want.*

##### Shifting Habits
CUT TO: Habit Tracker. Each day gets less consistent on healthy habits
*But I also think that sometimes, even with the best of intentions, we fall off track a little bit. It happens slowly, bit by bit, but eventually the habits shift until eventually they're completely unrecognizable from the original goal.*

CUT TO: Reading
*This is when extrinsic motivation is useful. Something resonates with us and gently pushes us back in the direction we want to be going.*

CUT TO: Talking head
*What I want to do is have some extrinsic motivation that I can rely on. I don't want to wait until it bumps into me in the wild. I want to purposefully engineer it into my life. Basically, I want to come up with a way to move that extrinsic motivation inwards.*


##### Mantras
CUT TO: Talking Head / Sequence about mantras.
*Have you ever heard of a mantra? It's a concept that originates from and is really common in Buddhism and Hinduism.*

*There's a few definitions.*

*Here's the one I'm most interested in.*

CUT TO: Displaying this somehow
"a statement or slogan repeated frequently."

*You see the point of motivation isn't often to learn anything new. It's to remind us of what we already know, and push us to act on that.*


##### My Current System
Discuss the list on my phone and what I use it for. Be sure to make the distinction between random little motivating instagram caption type things vs things you hear that really move you in some powerful way.

CUT ON ACTION: Swiping desk clean





*They're phrases that summarize world views that I hold and occasionally need a reminder of.*



# Hey new video!! It's a different thing now! And that's a good thing!

*So I've come up with a way to try and incorporate these mantras into my daily life. And I'm going to explain what that is in a second.*

*Right after I tell you about The Odyssey and how I lied to you earlier. Apparently this video is a little bit about habits.*



### The Odyssey Bit

*Let me set the scene. It's somewhere in the 8th or 7th century BC and Homer just dropped The Odyssey.*

*Some ridiculously long period of time later, you're forced to read it in high school. And you mostly don't pay attention, if you read it at all.*

*If you had been paying attention, though, you would've heard about when Ulysses had to sail past a bunch of Sirens' and in order to avoid succumbing to their song, he had his men tie him to the mast of the ship so he was physically incapable of falling into their trap.*

*This idea, now known as a Ulysses Pact, is incredibly powerful. Basically, you decide on a thing you want to do or a way you want to be in the world at a time where you can think clearly and rationally. Then, you design your life in such a way that success is actually easier than failure.*





*Now let's talk a little bit about public humiliation and then I'll get back to the mantras.*

*The opinions other people have about us matters a lot. And I know it's popular to say thing's like "I don't care what other people think of me" but it's not true. You might not care what everyone thinks, but other people's opinions of us are a matter of life and death.*

*Before we had things like phones and grocery stores and running water, our survival depended heavily on our tribe. And our tribe is people. And people are judgemental. Because if they're not, they get eaten by like a bear or something.* 


















*The whole point here is to find a way to give yourself small, consistent reminders of the direction we want to go in life.*

CUT TO: Back to building

VO:

*Imagine you're the main character in a movie. 
The main character doesn't lose track of the plot. They know what's going on and what they need to do. If they didn't it would be a weird and confusing movie.*

*But the main character in every movie, at some point, needs guidance. 
This is that guidance.*












Train Track Theory?? Sail Boat Theory?
Our habits are the engine.
These reminders serve as the track. You have to check your track often.

The hero/main character doesn't lose track of the plot.
But they do need guidance sometimes. This is that guidance.
