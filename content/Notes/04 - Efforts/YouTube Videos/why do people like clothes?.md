# Why do people care about clothes?
*I don't get why people care about clothes. But I want to. So I'm going to overcome the identity building beliefs that have got me here, and have some open discussions about why people find this important.*




For as long as I can remember, I've cared approximately not at all about clothing or how I'm dressed. My typical outfit is like a t-shirt, athletic shorts, and some running shoes. 

It feels super practical. I'm a pretty active person, and I like being always ready to do something.






- fashion show confusion
- wheezy waiter thrift shop example. Friends go and I just don't have an opinion.
- Pretty much total ignorance. It's not that I like or don't like certain things, it's that I have no foundation on which to like and not like things. You have to have a working knowledge of something to have an opinion, and I just don't.



My thoughts so far in life:

Why that's maybe changing?:
