# why is vintage stuff so popular?



## Story Structure

## Script

#### Intro
*INT. NIGHT*
*Walk into locked off frame. Turn on light, lighting up my face.*
*Grab a VCR from the mess on my desk. POV follow it to the TV. Put it in.*
*Slow push in on CRT TV. Eventually, we enter the TV as it starts playing.*


*(On the TV. Typing on a typewriter at my desk. This is the thumbnail shot.)* 
You've probably already noticed, but old stuff is trendy.
*As I say trendy, reset typewriter. On the bell, it cuts, but the word "VINTAGE?" stays on screen. Then we go into a sequence of showing old things that are popular.*


I first noticed this trend of vintage in the world of fashion.
But it quickly started popping up in more and more places. 
Interior design, advertising, YouTube.

Everyone in the creative industries seem to be moving in the same direction.


*Cut to me on my phone. Crash zoom as I look up, then look at camera*
And at first I thought this was just the typical cyclical nature of trends that we see throughout the years.

However. I keep noticing it in more and more places. And I'm starting to think something else is going on.

So, I did some digging. 

*Intro sequence into title*



I started by reading some articles about how trends have evolved over time. I compiled a bunch of them and wrote up this big summary that contextualized design trends from the past 100 years. 

Then I filmed this whole bit where I presented that information, imported the footage, saw how long just that was, and realized: 
*MED: Pull back through editing screen.*
Man this is boring.



So instead, I'll just show you what I distilled from it.

Basically, trends seem to be driven by a 3 main things, which we’ll get to.

The first is economic status at a societal level.
The prime example of this is minimalism vs maximalism. 
Generally speaking, when the economy is performing worse, minimalism is more popular. When it's doing well, maximalism starts to be more popular.

The 20s were a hugely maximalist decade, as was the mid century era.
The 30s were more minimalist, largely due to the great depression.
We see this happen again later in the 

If times are tough and people can't afford expensive things, then cheaper things get made, and design has to follow that. If the economics allow it, then design gets to experiment and innovate.

Which brings us to the second driver, technological innovation. From trains and factories to space ships and computers, the technology of a time largely impacts how people interact with their environments. It also provides a set of constraints that design has to exist within.

The final driver is that the youths want to rebel against their parents. Basically every decade is characterized by people looking at the last generation and being like, man, that's bad.
And they do the exact opposite. But when every generation does the exact opposite, trends end up swinging like a pendulum. And that's why I can dress like my grandpa and not look weird.






Basically I'm just wanting to convey the point of all that information. What's the gist?
Mostly, it's that every time there's a trend, there's a reaction. 
Most reactions are the opposite of what came before them. 
So trends have this natural swing back and forth. 
Also, design choices are heavily influenced by the technology of the time and the economic status of the world at the time.





So it seems like trends are driven by a 3 main things. 
*Maybe this can be shot in the car? "Drivers"*
The first is necessity. If people can't afford expensive things, then cheaper things get made, and design has to follow that. If the economics allow it, then design gets to experiment and innovate.

Which brings us to the second driver, technological innovation. From trains and factories to space ships and computers, the technology of a time largely impacts how people interact with their environments. It also provides a set of constraints that design has to exist within.

The final driver is that the youths want to rebel against their parents. Basically every decade is characterized by people looking at the last generation and being like, man, that's bad.
And they do the exact opposite. But when every generation does the exact opposite, trends end up swinging like a pendulum. And that's why I can dress like my grandpa and not look weird.




#### Old Intro

~~*Transition out of black with a shot through records as I pick one out*
*Record player shots*~~

~~You know, now that I think about it, I'm not sure that I fully understand what vintage even means. ~~


~~Like how old does something have to be to be considered vintage? Is there like a threshold or is it more of a you know it when you see (it kind of thing.) *cut it off*
~~


~~20 years. It's 20 years. Well, sometimes it's 20 years. ('Hooked on Vintage,' Fashion Theory, DeLong, Marilyn, Barbara Heineman, and Kathryn Reiley)~~

~~Check this out.
The word 'vintage' originally comes from the world of wine. Which now that I say that out loud it seems obvious, but I don't collect wine or even drink wine because I think it doesn't taste good I'd rather have juice like a 9 year old. Anyways.~~

~~In the world of wine, vintage refers to a particular age or year of wine, and usually includes the place of ori,
Then in the 1960s it was adapted to the world of clothing, and was used in a really similar way. 
A vintage piece of clothing was roughly equivalent to like, some good grapes, which meant it was probably worth buying. ~~

~~But language is alive and the word morphed into a more abstract and general description of old clothing. There was no specific time frame.~~

~~So when I say sometimes 20 years, I mean that the word vintage has meant a lot of different things over time.
But 20 years is a pretty widely accepted age now so we'll just stick with that to keep it simple.~~

~~Ok cool we know we what it means but where did this concept come from? Have people just always liked old things? I'm not sure yet.~~

~~What I do know is that vintage is trendy right now.~~

~~*Setting up lights*~~

~~And to understand why old stuff is cool, I think we need to figure out how trends trend in the first place.~~

~~Trends seem to trickle down throughout all of design, starting in the areas that have the quickest realization process. When you shrink the time between people making design choices and those choices actually materializing, trends can move a lot faster.~~

~~So, I spent a pretty obscene amount of time studying trends in photography, interior design, fashion, cinema, advertising, and graphic design across the past hundred years or so, and then looked at those trends within their respective historical contexts. Here's what I found. 
**This is a very American-centric view on the past century of trends.**~~

~~*Pull in green screen*~~


 

#### Act 1: Trends

##### 1920s
We begin in the 1920s. 

The second industrial revolution just wrapped up, which means huge advances in metals and electricity and transportation and, most relevant to this video, mass production.

Factories are able to just pump out product. Up until recently though, there's been a little bit of an elephant in the room gobbling up all the factory space.

But now World War 1 is over and factories are able to shift from weapons manufacturing to consumer goods. 

And although the economy was pretty rough during the war, it explodes afterwards. 

The period was characterized by leisure and luxury for the most amount of people in a like most of history up until that point.

Movies become an American pass time. Almost half of American households have radios. All this economic prosperity is giving people the extra energy to be creative. So Jazz.

~~More women are working than ever before in American history because all the dudes got drafted. But now they're back and are ready to work, but lots of women want to keep working, because money, so they do. And this brings them more economic independence than ever before. And so what do they do with it?
They cut their hair and wear scandalous dresses all the way up to their knees. *GASP*~~

~~Men are dressing in lighter colored suits, representative of the lighter time they're now living in.~~

~~And this seems to be a theme throughout, actually. ~~

After WWI, there was this general sense of celebration and being done with war forever because it was fought at such a large scale. It was an optimistic time and the future was bright. 

Which explains art deco. I mean look at this. Bold colors, geometric patterns, metallic finishes. 
A lot of this is influenced by the technology of the time. We turn trains and cars into a very streamlined aesthetic in our homes.

We've got refrigerators. We've got vacuum cleaners. We've got washing machines. Screw doing chores by hand, it's party time. How are we going to pay for all this stuff? 
Credit cards! 



*Newspaper about the stock market crash spins onto screen.*
##### 1930s
Oh.

So the 30s are weird. It's this huge contrast from the previous decade. 
It was the longest and most severe economic downfall ever experienced by the industrialized Western world. Economics are complicated and not really part of this video, but basically this is the worst situation America has been in since like the Civil War.

In the world of design, there was this mentality of futurism. They looked towards a better future, mostly because the present kinda sucked.

People couldn't really afford to buy things like they did in the 20s. So instead of engineering new products, there was a sort of stripping down of existing design that happened. A version of minimalism emerged out of necessity. 

Designs were streamlined, which made them easier to mass produce, which made them cheaper and more accessible. You can see this in everything from cars to dishes. 

~~The 30s were also the golden age of radio because it was cheap entertainment. So we see a lot of living rooms arranged around a central radio cabinet instead of all facing each other, kind of like how it is today with TVs.~~

The world of fashion kinda kept innovating. 

But it was mostly found in the celebrity world. The silver screen became a beacon of hope for a struggling society. 

If the 20s were a time of excess, the 30s were a time of, um, not excess. 
*Holding a thesaurus*
Moderation? Restraint? Lack? Insufficiency? 

##### 1940s
So like remember how we fought in that big war? And then like we had this whole decade characterized by celebrating that war was over? Well...

Basically all of America's resources are going to fighting again. Instead of making cheap plates and furniture, factories have to shift to making tanks and bullets and fighter planes.

Design kinda takes a beat here.

But the war ends in '45 and there's this huge economic expansion. Wait isn't that what happened last time a war ended? That's probably not important.

~~Anyways so everyone's coming back from the war, and now they want to buy houses and start families. So residential real estate demand just explodes, and builders have to find shortcuts to keep up. 
*Welcome to the suburbs* (Levittown)
Mostly this just means cheap materials and small houses. (around 1000sqft)
They also would just like leave part of the house for the homeowner to finish??
Which is where unfinished basements come from.~~

All the factories stop making weapons again, but it takes a while for them to retool (equip a factory with new or adapted tools.). 

The late 40s and 50s sort of bleed into each other a little bit because of this post war lag, but eventually we start to see a huge shift in design and consumer behavior.

##### 1950s
During the 50s, the United States is an absolute powerhouse. Wages soar and unemployment falls. To most, the Great Depression is a distant memory, and everyone just wants cars and furniture and houses and kids. So many kids. 

The suburbs continue to develop and begin to get connected by highway systems.

Rooms get painting in these bright happy colors.

There's also this weird thing where the atom bomb carries this insane cultural influence? So instead of being real about how horrible it was they just kind of processed these scary wartime things through atomic-inspired design? I don't know man. Looks cool though.

~~Open floors plans attempt to bring the outside in, and technology advances a bunch. 
By 1955, around half of American homes have a TV.~~

~~So~~ to balance out all of the modernism in design, lots of people used handmade crafts as decor.

Oh! Space! Space Race era technology was hugely influential on the design trends of the time. We see these motifs on everything. Clocks, lamps, upholstery, all over the place. 

It's a lot like how the design trends of the 20s were driven by transportation technologies like cars and trains, except now its space ships.

##### 1960s
The 60s sees a continuation of mid century modern design, but there's a counterculture blossoming. 

We see this huge rise in individualism now that time has past since the war.

The youths are rebelling against tradition and America is changing.
We've got the civil rights movement, women's right's movement, these dudes. (the Beatles)

Everything in design from fashion to home decor gets more dynamic and colorful.
~~There's a playfulness in it.~~

All these boomers are being born families want bigger houses to accommodate them. 

Economic prosperity is driving trends, so things like matching furniture become a status symbol. It showed you that you could afford to buy a whole room full of furniture all at the same time.

##### 1970s
In the 70s, people want to bring more natural colors and materials into the home. House plants become a big thing, and so do things like wicker, rattan, and macrame.

There's also like this big oil crisis that had people waiting in line for gas. 
That probably had something to do with people not using as many colorful plastics as in the 60s.

There's shaggy rugs, busy wallpaper, and very little black or white. Just so. much. color. And disco!

There's also soaring inflation. 

But instead of looking to the future like they did back in the great depression, American's fell out of love with machines and instead this started romanticizing the past and nature. 

##### 1980s
Minimalism is all but dead by the 80s. The underlying theme of design as a whole is excess. Bright colors are back and house plants are sent back outside. 

There's a sense of affluence and optimism.

There are lots of dual income households by this point. 

We also see the invention of the computer, which also means a new type of design:
Digital Graphic design. We see those same bold colors here too. 

It's a vibrant decade.



And I'm actually going to pause here for a second. 

Because from around the 60s on, American culture gets more and more fragmented.

It's not just one overarching culture. It's a culture and a counterculture. And then it's subcultures of those, and subcultures of those. 

As communication gets easier, people find other people that they connect with on increasingly niche interests. And the internet just accelerates that in a way that makes things really difficult to track.


***BREAK***


In addition, these historical summaries are just that: summaries. They leave out a lot of the story.

Like lets rewind to the 20s for a sec. 
Now when I was taught about the Roaring Twenties in school, they made it sound like it was just one big Great Gatsby party for like 10 years straight.
And maybe that's true for some people?

But what doesn't really get talked about is the wealth shift that occurred over the course of that decade. 
Towards the end of the 20s, the wealthiest 1 percent of people were receiving nearly 1/4 of all pretax income. 60% of families earned less than $2000 per year, which is like around $30k in 2024 money.  ([Roaring Twenties | Definition, Music, History, & Facts | Britannica](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Roaring-Twenties))

This is supposed to be the prime of America. So why do we see this massive wealth disparity between classes?


So why did I just spend like 5 minutes going through a history that's not even really an accurate depiction of what life was like? 

Well, mostly because those historical events were the ones driving the most widespread design trends of the time. 
In those eras, the upper classes drive those trends, so its useful to look at history through that lens.

It's also important because it helps us see the push and pull that goes on with society and trends and consumer behavior and everything in between. 




There's this book that explores and theorizes the cycles of history that America goes through. 

The theory goes into a lot more than I'm going to talk about here, but I'd highly recommend either watching a more in depth summary about it or reading the book itself.

Here's the basic premise.

In effect, you have these 4 categories or "Turnings" as the book calls it, of time periods. 

Each one lasts about 20 years. And these periods are driven by generations aging. 20 years is about how long it takes for generation to go from birth to adulthood, when they can start enacting changes in the society they live in.

You can think of these 4 periods sort of like the seasons within nature. Summer, autumn, winter, spring.


We'll start with spring, what the theory calls a "High".
This is an upbeat era. Institutions are strengthened. Individualism weakens. Society is community driven and content. 


Then comes summer. This is called the "Awakening". It's an era that includes a lot of spiritual changes in the culture. Because of the confidence born during the High, society is comfortable basically doing some soul searching. 


This leads us to the Autumn-like "Unraveling." We see a fragmentation of culture and lots of value debates. 


Finally comes winter, the "Crisis." This is a period with severe consequences. It's a harsh time. It ends an era and defines a generation's ability to respond. We are in a Crisis right now.



Let me give you some concrete examples that align with the timeline we just went through a second ago.

From the early 1900s up until 1929 when the stock market crashed was an Unraveling. An autumn. Even though the 20s were supposedly this massive party era where everyone was doing great, most people were not doing great. This period saw a massive wealth gap. There was reform and fundamentalism and crime and debates of alcohol and political corruption. It was a time of "do what feels good" as the people's vision for the future darkened and worldviews grow increasingly complex. 

The Stock market crash of 1929 kicked off the Crisis era, the winter, which continues through WW2. Times are tough. People are preoccupied by real, tangible struggle. It's a period defined by a sense of urgency to fix the world. 
There's not a lot of philosophical, spiritual exploration going on. It's time of pragmatism. Eventually, societal feelings transition to exhaustion, then relief, then optimism. 

This kicks off spring, the High, which starts when WW2 ends. Society is unified having just gone through tough times. The perspective of what the future could become gets brighter. 
This is when we see tradition American suburbs start to pop up everywhere. The vision for the American dream as we understand it today seems to have been born during this era. We've been fantasizing about this high since it happened. 

We shift towards an Awakening, summer, around 1964. Society is getting comfortable and forgetting about the hard times of the Crisis. We see rising individualism and spiritual exploration. Think like Woodstock.

Then finally, in the mid 80s, we shift towards an Unraveling again. National debt is growing, we see the same wealth gaps emerge as we did in the 20s, and the vision for the future grows darker once again.


The time in which a generation is raised shapes their values for the rest of their life. 

So we see a situation where current events shape the young generation of the time. As they grow, they become able to shape the environment in a way that reflects the values they've learned. And the way they shape the world impacts the climate of the society that future generations are raised in.

That tends to lead young generations to hold opposite values from their elders. 


And while in this this cyclical nature is super predictable in this particular society, it's not something that is only found in American history. It sort of seems to be a property of all human social systems.




And then we overlap design trends with all of this.


And we see that there are periods of relative economic prosperity and innovation but also a sort of 'ignoring the problems' mentality that usually comes with loud maximalist designs and flashy consumer goods. 

Then there's some sort of economic downturn, which is followed a pulling back on the consumer side. Design gets a lot more minimalist out of necessity. 

And then something happens, a lot of times a war, that makes things even worse for a little while, but eventually stimulates economic growth in some way that brings us back to a more prosperous state.

People begin getting comfortable innovating with design again. And the cycle continues.



So it seems like trends are driven by a 3 main things. 
*Maybe this can be shot in the car? "Drivers"*
The first is necessity. If people can't afford expensive things, then cheaper things get made, and design has to follow that. If the economics allow it, then design gets to experiment and innovate.

Which brings us to the second driver, technological innovation. From trains and factories to space ships and computers, the technology of a time largely impacts how people interact with their environments. It also provides a set of constraints that design has to exist within.

The final driver is that the youths want to rebel against their parents. Basically every decade is characterized by people looking at the last generation and being like, man, that's bad.
And they do the exact opposite. But when every generation does the exact opposite, trends end up swinging like a pendulum. And that's why I can dress like my grandpa and not look weird.



#### Act 2: The Emergence of Vintage



*INT. WI Top down shot. Sitting on the floor. Papers surrounding me.*

Okay that was a lot of information. And it tells us a lot about trends and how they get started and how things change over time and how cycles repeat.


But we still don't really know where this idea of vintage really starts to take hold. 

So I dug some more. And eventually, I found a paper that gives us a good starting point.

*I look up and throw them. Camera tracks up through the roof, up to global level, over to London.*


And that starting point is London. In the 1960s. 
*London, warp into historical imagery, buildings pop.*

Remember how factories in America are able to create mass produced consumer goods because of the whole industrial revolution thing? Well, that's true in a lot of the world. 

And now that factory made clothing is widely available and relatively cheap, secondhand clothing becomes associated with poverty.

And in this weird social status game that everyones playing, wearing clothes that are associated with being poor isn't cool, so people stop wearing used clothes. 

That is until the 1960s in London. 

*Zoom over to markets*
During this time, there's these things called rag markets that start popping up. It starts mostly because there's a recession and this is a way for people to make extra money selling clothes.

But there's also a rebellious aspect to it. At this point in Britain there's this sort of alternative consumerism emerging. There's a new emphasis on 'natural' products and a general move away from typical consumerism.
I even saw one article that referred to the way certain people dressed at the time as "outlaw fashion" which I thought was kinda sick.
So wearing vintage clothing emerges out of an inherently anti-consumerism cultural movement.

But over time, the line between high fashion and street style starts to get fuzzy. 

And the idea of wearing old clothes starts to become accepted, largely because pop culture consisted of lots of retro-themed films, TV, and books.

*Map to NYC with vintage moving over*
Eventually, this idea makes it's way out of London, across the ocean, and into New York City.

These little resale shops start popping up to sell secondhand clothing. But its not like regular clothing. This is designer level clothing, and really only up to 2 years old. Anything older gets refused. 

But still, it's a big contrast from before. There's even an article that mentions a shop where the actress Barbra Streisand apparently shopped, which is a spark that begins moving vintage from poverty to celebrity status.

In 1967 an article from the New York Times talks about old clothing as something for "the most fashion-conscious youths of an affluent generation," "the more esoteric the better."

At this point, vintage is still pretty niche, and the articles about it at the time seem to be kind of mocking it, but that starts to shift in the 70s. 

"the beginning of a new fashion era" - from the 70s part of the paper

Wearing old clothing starts to become mainstream. People are raiding the vintage boutiques and consignment shops and thrift stores. 




Because of this shift, the media at the time decided to ask people why they preferred old clothes over shopping new.
Actually, over the years there has been quite a bit of research done concerning why people shop vintage.

And from what I can tell, there are really 7 main reasons:


The price. I mean, this one feels pretty obvious. Second hand stuff is significantly cheaper than buying new stuff. The difference between the economic value of a new object and an object that is used, even if they're in ostensibly the same condition, is surprisingly large. The actual amount varies depending on the type of object, of course. A car, for example, depreciates a lot as soon as you drive it off the lot of a dealership, while something like a house holds it's value for much longer.

The originality. If you buy something vintage, you can be sure that you're not going to run into someone else wearing the same thing as you. This might not be something that everyone cares about, but lots of people do. And in a world of mass production, it can be difficult to find something unique in a typical store or online.

Eco-consciousness. This one seems like more of an afterthought honestly. Most people don't make decisions because of this, but it's a nice benefit when it happens and helps reinforce the behavior. Nothing like a sense of moral superiority to get you to double down on what you're doing.

Nostalgia. Certain people long for the past, and while it might not be based in anything tangible, they have a sense that things were just better back in the day, so buying older things fulfills that nostalgic need.

The Experience. As companies shift into lifestyle marketing in the 80s, brand image starts to become emphasized over a product's intrinsic qualities. Because of this, department stores start to organize their floors based on brand rather than by item type. This makes it hard to comparison shop for different styles, but it also drains the sense of discovery from the shopping experience. 

Authenticity. **EXPAND** 

Quality. This is the point that seems the most compelling to most people. Because of the transition into mass production, the quality that larger companies are able to produce drops dramatically. So people turn towards older materials, older techniques, to get something of high quality. 



So because of these reasons, vintage gets so popular that shop owners actually start getting worried about supply.

And anytime something gets that popular, capitalism gets curious.

So we start to see these massive corporations taking these old designs and recreating them, but with the same lower quality materials and techniques and watered down shopping experience that people are trying to get away from. 

At this point though it doesn't matter, because the trend has started to get published in magazines and bleed into pop culture. And not everyone cares about these reasons for vintage, or knows the difference. 

So "retro" gets just as popular.

And while these words are kind of used interchangeably, retro is usually referring to the reproduction of an old thing rather than the old thing itself. 

So the word vintage is sort of a semantic attempt to reclaim authenticity for genuinely old 
objects.


What's crazy is that this started as an inherently anti-consumerism movement. And now it's a trend that's being fueled by large corporations. 

And in recent decades this has gone even further. 

Companies have taken the mass production manufacturing process of post war factories to a new level. 

New materials and techniques are being created. Companies like Zara and Ikea are making things that are good enough to ship across an ocean but won't last much longer than that. 

And the price is incredible, don't get me wrong. Especially in a time where disposable income is decreasing as cost of living increases.

But these companies still have to squeeze a profit out of these products. So they make them as cheaply as possible and use their scale to their advantage.


And then, in 2012, someone creates what I'd argue to be the single most culturally important piece of media ever produced for the popularization of old objects. 
*Thrift Shop plays in the background*

Jokes aside, this song did do a lot to popularize the idea of vintage. It helped make old objects, mostly clothing, seem cool to a young American generation.


And that's why the demand for vintage has grown so much over the past few decades. 

Higher quality materials and manufacturing techniques. 
A better consumer experience. 
Macklemore
Originality
Cost


That's why old stuff is so popular.

Basically, this video was a long winded way of saying: they don't make em like they used to.

Case closed. 





Wait. How do we decide what old stuff gets popular? 




#### Act 3: The Creation and Destruction of Value


How does an object hold value? What does it mean for an object to be valuable?

When I think about the value of an object, I'm tempted to think about that thing's intrinsic, empirical value. 

But in reality, objects don't really have intrinsic value. The value of an object only really lies in how a person or lots of people interact with that object. 

Value is constructed socially, not through how important something is for our survival (although that's a factor), but through collective beliefs.

The final portion of this video is dedicated to finding out how something can be of value, and then slowly decline in importance until it is all but forgotten, and then one day emerge from the ashes as a possession more valuable than ever before.


To give you a concrete example of this, let's talk about film, film cameras, and the style of film in general. 

There was a point where film was a technological marvel. It's was new and exciting and people were able to capture life and revisit it. 

And when digital came around, slowly, most people transitioned. It was new technology, an innovation that made a worthy replacement for film due to the ease and cost of use.

Recently though, and if you're even close to the video or photography space then you already are very aware of this, film has had a massive resurgence. 

So much so that the price of film has gone way up. So has the resale market of old film cameras. 

We're even seeing companies produce new film or film emulation technologies to bring us this nostalgic feeling. 

Some really well received, like the Fuji x100v that was impossible to get for like 2 years straight because people loved it so much, and some questionable like this Kodak Super 8 camera for almost $6,000.


The point I'm trying to make is that in, I don't know, 2017, the demand for film cameras was small hyper niche. 

The style of the time was to get these super clean, digital looking images, so that's what manufacturers made. Film was pretty cheap because nobody really wanted it. 

But today, it seems like everyone's trying to get that film look now. So following the demand, companies are making products that do that. Actual film prices have gone through the roof. 

Film technologies have regained their value in the marketplace because the artistic look that is popular right now drove it there.



Let's look at another example.

The mid century modern style of furniture was first developed in the 50's by companies like Herman Miller and Knoll.

Some of their pieces (the Eames chair and Womb Chair, for example) reached the point where most people recognized them. Crazy popular.

And right now, this style is still pretty popular. We see a lot of the styles of that era being pretty relevant today, with the abundance of lamps and warm tones and colorful splashes.

But even just 5 years ago this was not the case. Everything was clean and rigid and minimalist and "modern."

So while we see lots of companies taking design notes from this mid century era now, just a few years ago this stuff would've been basically worthless. 


Junk. Trash. Rubbish.


Rubbish Theory is a book that was originally published in 1979. This new edition is from 2017, just to give you some context on this information.

When it first released, the ideas that Michael Thompson explores were pretty counter to how economists determined value, but he makes the case that they were missing a crucial piece of the puzzle, and developed an idea that's now foundational to the field: rubbish theory.

It's something we pretty much ignore. It's discarded from our lives and therefore our minds. It lives outside of the concerns of economic theory. 

But some objects, although pretty rarely, re-enter the value circulation as a prized possession, and can even reach the status of priceless.

Here's how it happens.




 





#### New Ideas




I've been focusing on the history and the facts about this. But I should pivot to talking about how it personally impacts me. And how to be the Individualist / Artist is able to make things valuable regardless of norms.


It's a video about how people have the power to make things interesting through how they use it.




How would Shaffer make this video?
He'd probably try and connect it to something unrelated, because [[creativity is the processes of creating connections]]. 

There also would probably be some sort of action in real life, away from digital land. Which makes sense. That's kind of the whole point of the vintage movement anyways.

But what?











So instead of putting you through all of that, I decided to just show you this.






There's this pull for us as creatives, as artists. It's a pull to shift our creative preferences towards whatever new wave of creative material is becoming popular. 

But you can't catch a wave as it's already going by you. 

So basically we should just be worried about creating things that we think are awesome and not worry about what's "popular".





The real idea here is that instead of chasing trends, we should aim to create them. That's the creation of value. If not economic value, artistic value.
This is a reminder to myself to be more focused on creating style that chasing one.










## Scratch Pad


I could incorporate my personal interactions with vintage.
- Working at ACO, not understanding why certain things were being thrown out.







- How do class differences impact the trend cycle?





The types of people that are able to make the shift from rubbish to durable tell us a lot about the qualities our culture values at the time. Since all of these statues valuations are social constructs, the people who we allow to decide what becomes valuable, or Durable, are sort of representative of the culture's values. 
Right now, we seem to be valuing artists who find importance in reusing old things, in not wasting. They value quality of mass production. And this is representative of a shift in our culture. We are moving away from being a wasteful, mass produced society and towards one of care and intention. At least I hope that's what this means.








With the way the economic environment is now, it's a desire for the security and stability of the past that this generation has never known.


Quality of the past
Nostalgia
Sense of stability
Consumerism
Marketing?
How do trends cycle? Is this just an overcorrection of an overcorrection?
Monoculture from trying to make the most money
Conspicuous consumption

Sequence explaining trends over the decades.






Random TikTok
- Conspicuous consumption used to just be for the upper class.
	- The middle class tends to look to the upper class and try to be more like that?

	- People that spend the most money on keeping up with the Jones's are usually uncertain in themselves.
	- Lower tolerance for uncertainty leads to more conspicuous consumption
	- This is much worse for the middle class because they have less disposable income.
		- Many people are in debt because of their overspending. Typically on shoes, clothes, etc.




It kinda seems like the trends are just children rebelling against their parents, only to turn into their grandparents??





Trends seem to trickle down throughout all design, starting in the areas that have the quickest realization process. 
Fashion is relatively quick to go from design to product, so you'll see those trends move faster than something like interior design or architecture. 
But the trends trickle throughout.
