# Foreflight application script

Basic outline
- Intro / Bio
- Background in aviation
- Present a promo I made for them
- Explain the decisions I made to create that promo



*Text on "hi"*

Hi! My name's Tyler. 

*Editor position breaks through careers page and I click on it.*

I heard there was the possibility of an editor position opening up at Foreflight. 

*When I click, video of me editing from behind the monitor pops up*

And I thought, "hey, I'm an editor."

So, here we are. 

*Close laptop*


I've spent the past 7 or so years working in video production.

*Show these things in graphics*

It's been a pretty wide range of experiences so far. I've worked on event videos, made lots of corporate videos, worked with professional YouTube creators, and have done a bit of motion graphics and animation. 

*Talking head*

I'm sure one of the hardest parts about expanding the team at Foreflight is finding people who are both talented in their skillset and passionate and knowledgable about aviation. 

Now, the talent part isn't really for me to decide, but I definitely check the aviation box.

*Photos and videos*

I started flight training back in 2021. At the time, I was at a sort of crossroads and was considering pursuing flying as a career. I ended up not going that direction and stayed with video production. And I think that turned out to be the right decision, but unfortunately all of the information I accumulated during that training sits mostly dormant and I'd love to be able to put it to use again.

Now it's one thing for me to tell you "Hey I have lots of experience and think I'd be the perfect fit for this company."

But I think it's much more useful if I just show you a thing. 

So I put together this little video that could ostensibly live among social posts around release announcements.

Now I know that the world of video creation can be a bit, I guess secretive and complicated.

Because of that, I want to give you a little bit of a backstage pass into my creative process for making this little promo. This will hopefully show you what it could be like if we were, say, working on an upcoming release and going through revisions. 

*(Probably just say the step number and let the visual do the name here.)*

Step one for me is always Setting The Tone. I actually learned this from a book by an old writing professor at Yale. He wrote about how reading things you admire and hope to capture the essence of before you begin can be really helpful. In this case, I took a look at some of Foreflight's recent work, as well as some videos I really like and think could help influence this video.

Step two is Planning. Since I'm not shooting anything for this, and likely wouldn't be for most of the work we do going forward, this is more of an outline of the flow of the video. A bullet list will do just fine.

And this is actually a great time for a collaborator to step in, look at my list, and say: "Oh hey I think we should actually move this over here and add this."
By doing it this way, we save a bunch of time in revisions on the backend. 

This is sort of a guiding principle for me in general. We don't want to waste time redoing things if there was a way to prevent it. Instead, we should be spending our revision time fixing things that we couldn't have easily planned for. This means we can finish videos quicker and ultimately make a lot more of them.


Step three is actually a lot of sub steps, and I won't bore you with the details, but this is where we Layout The Video. Once we have a reasonably watchable draft, this is another great point for comments.

Step four is Polishing. This involves meticulously adding sound design, color grading, and anything else we might have missed. 

Step five is Final Revisions.


As you can see, this process is designed to allow us to adjust the amount of input from the team throughout the creation of any given video based on the team's schedules and how critical the details of the video are. 

Great creative works are often not made by committee, but great ideas are almost never had in isolation. I think balancing these two opposing principals is the key to creating something worth watching.
