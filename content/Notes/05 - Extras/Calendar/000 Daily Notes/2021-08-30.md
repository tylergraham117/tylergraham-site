- Jrnie's godmother Carol is in town. I've noticed she is quite inconsiderate of others. I wonder if there is some sort of way to measure people's ability to think about what they do and think. [[metacognition]] may play a role in this. 
- Listened to [No Stupid Questions: What's the best advice you've ever gotten?](https://pca.st/episode/ac2a3295-c251-4163-9f15-d776937f6d72)
	- Talked about why people don't take good advice. The conclusion was that it is mostly unsolicited, making people feel uncomfortable with other's assumptions that they need advice in the first place.
	- They discussed a study about interventions and college kids surrounding advice.
	- Life is a story. It doesn't matter what the "right" story is, because that doesn't exist. We just have to try and tell a good one.
	- [[Opportunity Cost]]
		- Sometimes the options we don't pursue are just as important as the ones we do because they make room for the good things that have happened. 
		- Success is less about talent and more about choice.
		- Reminded me of [[we are helped by what is to use what is not]]
