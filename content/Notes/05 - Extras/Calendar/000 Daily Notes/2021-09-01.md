- Its September!!!
- I've been thinking a lot about the whole idea of [[input controls output]]. It definitely needs more work, but I think I'll try to fill that out a bit more and get working on a script. It seems like it could be a great video.
- Yesterday, Jrnie told me about her new system of seeking out issue within herself and trying to "fix" them.
	- I really enjoyed the process she took on the path.
	- I am not sure if the word "fix" is ideal, but I think the way she interprets it is useful to her and gentle enough to make practical sense. The whole fixing debate gets really philosophical, almost to the point of uselessness. 
- I am a bit worried about this insurance exam. I think I'll probably do okay by the time it comes around, but I absolutely need to focus on studying pretty intensely. 
- I started tracking habits in a streaks app yesterday. I think the gamification will probably encourage me to continue the habit, especially because nothing I decided to consider a habit so far is something that is surrounded by very much friction. I do most of them already, this just encourages it more frequently and allows me to track my progress.
- People are not good with ambiguity. Especially in business. "[Become an Uncertainty Killer](https://ofdollarsanddata.com/become-an-uncertainty-killer/)"
	- This article discusses how we can improve in our business relationships by decreasing uncertainty within a project. This has some real, practical applications.
- Nick also has a great article about the importance of saving/investing from an early age. "[Go Big, Then Stop](https://ofdollarsanddata.com/go-big-then-stop/)"
