# [[2021-09-03]]

- Slept in until around 8 today.
- I want to be a bit more precise with my time tracking today, as both an experiment and potentially a tool. 
- I wonder if my journaling strategy lacks introspection and instead consists mostly of outward thinking. I may need to start looking inwards more often in this by observing my actions and comparing how they align with my thoughts.
