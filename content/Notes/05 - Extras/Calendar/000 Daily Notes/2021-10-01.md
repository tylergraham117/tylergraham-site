- I haven't been consistent with any of my writing or journaling practices. However, I don't necessarily feel as if I've been distracted or anything. I've been focused on the "wealth" pillar of life, which I've come to see as more important than I used to realize. This has led me to not necessarily chase money, but has provided me the resolve to drive myself towards positions of making it. I've been meditating infrequently, but absolutely more than I was previously. Anything is better than nothing. The mental clarity I feel after meditating is unparalleled, and I really think I should try to become more consistent with it, especially considering it takes about ten minutes for a full session on the Waking Up app.
