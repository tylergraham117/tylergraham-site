##### A story from yesterday:
Isaiah, Charles, Llana, Chris, and Raymond came over after they watched The Batman. We made them some tacos. Gathering in our home felt really nice. I'd like to have things prepared ahead of time, or have people involved in the creation of it. No bystanders. Llana doesn't like hard shells, and prefers flour to corn. They appreciated the cutting board.
