##### A story from yesterday:

I've been building a habit of running recently. I've noticed that, whenever I pass someone going in the opposite direction, I feel a surge of energy. I think this may be attributed to the sense of community and kinship I feel with that person. We've both separated ourselves from our daily lives to put ourselves into something uncomfortable. There is an underlying sense of desire and striving for a better life. Not only do we wish something, we are putting forth the action to make it be. Yesterday, I tried to pass this feeling along. A man who had clearly been running for quite a while came close. We both waved at each other. I attempted a high five as he ran by, but I put the offer out too late and he didn't see it until he was gone. He turned around and wave, so the sentiment was definitely there. I was glad to see that. I think that the simple joy of a high five brings people energy when they're tired. Something about a stranger saying, "Good job, keep it up, I'm in there with you," without actually saying anything is comforting. I think I'll continue to do this, and try to liven up people's runs. Most people don't really enjoy it all that much, so it could be good to raise the spirits of my little running loop.
