##### A story from yesterday:



##### Today:
Bailey passed this morning. We all knew it was coming, and she had a really wonderful, full life. There's a somber feeling in my heart, but also a warmth in knowing that she did not suffer any terrible health. Her decline was relatively quick, and if she was in much pain she didn't show it. She was always playful and source of joy for anyone around her. I loved her and will miss her a lot.
