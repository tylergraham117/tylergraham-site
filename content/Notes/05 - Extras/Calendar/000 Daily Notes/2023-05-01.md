# Scratchpad:

[[labels expire]]. An identity you adopt based on action only exists as long as you continue that action. 
If you stop being an athlete, you're not one anymore.
If you stop being a good friend, you're not one anymore.

If you're not sure which direction to go, [[consider who you admire]]. This helps reveal your values. We admire people because, at some level, we want to be like them.

[[plans are just predictions]] about what you think the best use of your time might be. But what do you know?

Try writing down any thoughts or things you say that are disempowering. 
"I can't do x because y" 

On mentorship/mentors:
Think about your problem. Write it in detail. Summarize it. Think about how your "mentor" or really anyone (be specific) would solve this issue. Now you probably don't need to ask the question anymore. [[imaginary mentors]]

AI removes the need for memorization based professions. What we really need, now more than ever, are people that discover and create. New things to train models. New ideas. 
Apparently some study found that chatGPT is more effective that physicians. (Probably a trick of statistics, but still.) [[thoughts on AI]]

Pick a game to play, learn the rules, win the game. [[game theory]]
