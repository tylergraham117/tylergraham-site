# Scratchpad:

Stop trying to solve imaginary problems.

Solve your problems.

Change your own life.

Package up the method.

Slap a price tag on it.

You're less likely to fail if you solve real, meaningful problems.

This is the problem with most people entering business.

They don't have an understanding of marketing, sales, psychology, or evolution in general.

Stop trying to land on Saturn or build a billion-dollar tech company when a majority of the population is suffering from low-consciousness problems (that are holding the collective ego back from enlightenment).

Start as a [micro education business](https://powershift.krtra.com/c/W0KXbxaTZjoQ/jx1v6) that helps people solve the _real_ problems in their life.
