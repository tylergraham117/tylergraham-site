# Scratchpad:



*From Sahil Bloom*
**If you woke up three years from now and were living your ideal life, what were the three things you did to get you there?**

I'm a big fan of mental time travel.

It's a neat trick for creating gratitude (think about yourself five years ago and how amazed you would be at where you are today) or perspective (think about yourself 30 years from now and how much you'd long to be back where you are today).

I also like using mental time travel as an exercise to deconstruct necessary actions in the present.

If you imagine yourself in three years completely in the "flow" (personally, professionally, spiritually), what actions had you taken to get you there?

What did you do today, next week, next month, and next year that started you on the path to that future flow?

Be specific:

- What positive systems did you create?
- What bad habits did you eliminate?
- What positive environments did you enter?
- What negative environments did you exit?
- Who did you spend time with?
- Who did you create distance from?

Whether you're in the flow today or not, asking this question regularly will help you pause and set your present compass in the direction of a beautiful future reality.

Remember: Focus on direction, not speed. It's better to go slowly up the right mountain than fast up the wrong one.
