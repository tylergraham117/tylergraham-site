All the writers say that if you want to get better, you should fall in love with the writing and do it every day. That doesn't mean you love it everyday. Most of the time, [[writers seem to hate writing]]. But it's what they live for. 

I'd like to get better at writing. I'm okay, but I'd really love it if I could tell stories that deeply impact people. Often, the biggest hurdle I face to getting in the chair to write is that I usually don't know what I'm writing for. Am I journaling? Is it for a video? A newsletter? Will I release it or is it private? I suppose none of that really matters. Either way it's a draft and I can adapt it to whatever format I need.

But the [[medium is the message]], which can be an unfortunate reality to writing (or creative expression in general). 

But it also serves as a nice prompt. 

Prompts are really useful because they serve as limitations. Limitations make us more creative because they force us to work within some set parameters. If someone says "make something," we're a deer in the headlights, paralyzed by the [[paradox of choice]]. If someone says "make something but include a bouncy ball," now we've got something.
