# Story of the Day:

Isaiah and Amber came over to finish their cutting boards. They were looking forward to it all week apparently. I really appreciate building things with people. It's fun to mix different styles and levels of expertise. 
I wish I was better at having a conversation while building, but I get focused on one and can't do the other very well. Might be something to work on.


I finished a YouTube video for the first time in almost a whole year! That was pretty rewarding. 
I doubt anyone will watch it, but its good momentum, and [[the hardest part of anything is starting]]. Overcome the resistance is always a good thing.
