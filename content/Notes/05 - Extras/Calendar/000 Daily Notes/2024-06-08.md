- Last night was Shakar's gala. It was a pretty small turnout, but she seemed pleased with how it went. I think she tends to hide feelings of embarrassment when it comes to things like that (and the plane incident), so maybe she was more disappointed than she led on.
	- Something I couldn't stop thinking about was how incredible Jrnie is at starting conversations with strangers that seem to be uninterested in talking. I'll never get used to how incredible this quality is. It's definitely something she's practiced a lot over the course of her life. She's able to [[ask better questions]] than most, in a way that really gets people talking, leading everyone to [[have more impactful conversations]]. 
		- Some observations on how: 
			- Includes everyone (if someone new sits down she involves them immediately.)
			- Relates new information back to things they've already said.
