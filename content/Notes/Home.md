## The Format

### Folder Structure

Inbox (Default location. For encounters and ideas.)

Sources (A place for any external source to go, with commentary and thoughts about it.)

Notes 

Index (Lists with compilations of tags. Can be turned into a sort of table of contents for a subject matter over time.)

Efforts (A place for things I am doing. Things like my YouTube channel, or Newsletter, or or anything else I decide to do.)

Extras (Templates, images, etc. Just a misc area basically.)

### Tags
Tags are broken up into categories.

#### "On" Tag
"On" tags refer to the subject matter of the note. It's a note "on" learning, for example.
These should avoid being too broad, but also not so specific that you'll never use it again.
Every tag should eventually get an index page. 

#### "Status" Tag
"Status" tags tell me what the state of a given note is.

*'#status/scratch📝'* - This means the note was taken quickly and needs to be either explored or deleted.
*'#status/boat🚤'* - The note is not connected to any other notes. It needs to be linked.
*'#status/idea🌱'* - The note is a clear idea. It might have some connections, but overall it can stand on it's own as a though.
*'#status/miniessay📓'* - The idea has been turned into a proper mini essay. There are links and references at the bottom, but the note itself stands on it's own. This is something that could be released to the public.
'*status/essay📜*' - A full blown essay.
*'#status/oversized🚛'* - The note has gotten too big. It needs to be either simplified or split into separate ideas or miniessays.

#### "Source" Tags
"Source" tags are for different inputs.


#### "Log" Tags
For journal and meeting notes, as well as memories I have about the past.




Potential problems:
- I have nowhere for video scripts
- Doesn't incorporate daily notes/journal
-
